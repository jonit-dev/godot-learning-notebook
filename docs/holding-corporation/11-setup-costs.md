## When to setup?

Determining the threshold at which it becomes worthwhile to set up a holding company involves considering various factors, including the complexity of your assets, the potential tax savings, and the costs involved. Here are some key considerations:

### Factors to Consider

1. **Value of Non-Registered Assets**:

   - **Threshold**: Typically, if you have non-registered investments or assets worth at least $500,000, it may be worth considering a holding company. This value can justify the setup and maintenance costs through potential tax savings and asset protection benefits.

2. **Income Splitting Opportunities**:

   - **Family Members**: If you have family members who can benefit from income splitting, the tax savings from distributing dividends among lower-income family members can justify the costs of setting up a holding company.

3. **Tax Deferral Benefits**:

   - **Corporate Tax Rates**: By retaining earnings within a corporation, you can defer personal income taxes. This is particularly beneficial if your personal income tax rate is significantly higher than the corporate tax rate.

4. **Complexity and Control**:

   - **Multiple Investments**: If you have multiple business interests or a diversified investment portfolio, a holding company can provide centralized management and control, making it easier to manage and protect your assets.

5. **Estate Planning**:
   - **Succession and Transfer**: If you are considering estate planning and want to efficiently transfer wealth to your heirs, a holding company can facilitate this process and provide significant tax advantages.

### Cost-Benefit Analysis

1. **Setup Costs**:

   - Initial setup costs for a holding company in Canada typically range from CAD 1,000 to CAD 6,000, including incorporation fees, legal fees, and initial organization costs.

2. **Ongoing Costs**:

   - Annual maintenance costs, including filing fees, accounting fees, and legal fees, range from CAD 2,000 to CAD 15,000.

3. **Potential Savings**:
   - **Tax Savings**: Potential savings from tax deferral, income splitting, and lower corporate tax rates can be substantial. For example, retaining earnings in a corporation at a 15% small business tax rate instead of paying a 50% personal tax rate can result in significant tax savings.
   - **Asset Protection**: Protecting personal assets from business liabilities and creditors can also add value, though it's harder to quantify.

### Practical Example

- **Non-Registered Assets**: Suppose you have non-registered investments worth CAD 1 million.
- **Income**: If these investments generate CAD 100,000 in annual income.
- **Tax Savings**: By using a holding company, you could potentially defer a significant portion of taxes, especially if you are in a high personal tax bracket.

### Recommended Thresholds

| **Net Worth Range**         | **Recommendation**                                                                       | **Justification**                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **$0 - $100,000**           | Focus on maximizing TFSA and RRSP contributions.                                         | TFSA and RRSP provide sufficient tax advantages at lower net worth levels.                                         |
| **$100,000 - $500,000**     | Consider setting up a holding company if there are significant non-registered assets.    | Initial setup costs might be justified if there are substantial non-registered investments.                        |
| **$500,000 - $1 Million**   | Establish a holding company to manage non-registered investments and business interests. | Tax deferral, income splitting, and centralized management benefits start to outweigh setup and maintenance costs. |
| **$1 Million - $2 Million** | Set up a holding company and explore family trust options for estate planning.           | Increased benefits from tax planning, estate planning, and asset protection justify the structure.                 |
| **$2 Million+**             | Implement a combination of holding company and family trust.                             | Significant potential for tax savings, income splitting, and efficient estate planning.                            |

### Conclusion

A holding company becomes more beneficial as your net worth and the complexity of your assets increase. Typically, a net worth threshold of around $500,000 to $1 million in non-registered assets makes the setup and ongoing costs of a holding company worthwhile due to the potential tax savings, asset protection, and estate planning advantages. Consulting with financial and legal professionals is essential to tailor the structure to your specific needs and circumstances.
