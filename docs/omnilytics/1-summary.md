## Why this solution?

Omnilytics is specifically targeting startups and small businesses (SMBs). This is a key differentiation point for the company, as it's focusing on a specific segment of the market with unique needs and challenges.

Here's why Omnilytics is focusing on this segment:

- **PMF Focus:** Startups are primarily concerned with achieving product-market fit (PMF). Omnilytics is specifically designed to help them achieve this, unlike more general business intelligence (BI) tools.
- **Limited Resources:** Startups typically have limited budgets and workforce, making it difficult to hire data analysts or purchase expensive BI tools. Omnilytics' user-friendly design and no-code setup cater to this constraint.
- **Rapid Decision-Making:** Startups need to make quick decisions based on data to adapt quickly to market changes. Omnilytics provides real-time insights and AI-driven recommendations to facilitate faster decision-making.
- **Growing Market:** The global business intelligence (BI) and analytics market is expected to reach $50 billion by 2026. Omnilytics is well-positioned to capture a significant share of this market by focusing on the fast-growing startup segment.

## Main Pain Points

- **Data Silos:** Startups often struggle to gather data from different sources and integrate it into a single view. Omnilytics addresses this by offering a centralized platform for data integration.
- **Limited Resources:** Startups lack the budget or expertise to perform comprehensive data analysis. Omnilytics solves this by providing user-friendly, AI-powered insights and coaching.
- **Rapid Decision-Making:** Startups need to adapt quickly to market changes and make fast decisions. Omnilytics offers real-time insights and personalized recommendations to help startups react faster.
