# UFO Encounters and Religious Experiences: Patterns, Parallels, and Perspectives

## Introduction  
Unexplained encounters—whether interpreted as UFO sightings or divine visitations—have been reported across cultures and eras. Striking similarities between modern alien encounter stories and historical religious or mystical experiences have led scholars to explore their common threads ([

By examining credible sources (academic studies, government reports, and works by reputable researchers), we can identify recurring narratives and themes, psychological interpretations, and sociological contexts that link UFO phenomena with traditional religious experiences. This analysis looks at both historical and modern cases, highlighting how different cultures and disciplines have interpreted these encounters, and discussing scientific explanations or alternative hypotheses for the overlaps.

## Shared Narratives and Themes  
Many UFO encounter narratives mirror elements of classic religious or mythical experiences. Common themes include:

- **Mysterious Lights in the Sky:** Both UFO sightings and religious miracles often feature dazzling lights or aerial phenomena. For example, during the famous **Fatima** event of 1917 (interpreted by Catholics as a Marian miracle), thousands reported seeing a “weird disk…emitting a bright flash…turning rapidly…zig-zagging” in the sky ([The Miracle Of Fatima: A Visit By Mary—or Something Stranger? | Tom Rapsas](https://www.patheos.com/blogs/wakeupcall/2021/05/the-miracle-of-fatima-a-visit-by-mary-or-something-stranger/#:~:text=When%20the%20children%20would%20address,sums%20it%20up%20this%20way)). Witnesses heard a buzzing sound like “bees,” and saw a **“luminous globe”** ascend into the sun ([The Miracle Of Fatima: A Visit By Mary—or Something Stranger? | Tom Rapsas](https://www.patheos.com/blogs/wakeupcall/2021/05/the-miracle-of-fatima-a-visit-by-mary-or-something-stranger/#:~:text=When%20the%20children%20would%20address,sums%20it%20up%20this%20way))—details that uncannily match many modern UFO reports. Historical records from 1561 in Nuremberg similarly describe cylindrical and spherical objects in a celestial **“battle,”** which 16th-century observers took as a divine omen rather than extraterrestrial craft. Such reports of **fiery wheels, disks, or lights** have been interpreted according to the worldview of the time: *signs from God* in a religious context, or *alien spacecraft* in a modern UFO context. In both cases, the **awe and terror** evoked by luminous phenomena are comparable to the **numinous** feelings described in religious texts (theologian Rudolf Otto’s *mysterium tremendum et fascinans*, a fearful and fascinating mystery ([UFO belief is a modern outlet for ancient spiritual yearnings | Psyche Ideas](https://psyche.co/ideas/ufo-belief-is-a-modern-outlet-for-ancient-spiritual-yearnings#:~:text=lessons%3A%20firstly%2C%20that%20planetary%20crisis,had%20gone%20out%20of%20hand))).

- **Encounters with Otherworldly Beings:** Many experiences feature **non-human entities** that appear to the witness. In religious narratives these may be angels, demons, jinn, or spirits; in UFO accounts they are aliens or extraterrestrials. The descriptive parallels are noteworthy – beings of light or with supernatural abilities are common to both. For instance, **angels** in biblical stories guide or warn humans, and **alien visitors** in UFO lore often do the same. Religion scholar Benjamin Zeller observes that traditional religious believers accept “superhuman angels and demons, and a universe beyond human comprehension,” while UFO believers similarly insist on powerful extraterrestrials (sometimes viewed as benign **“angelic”** helpers or malign **“demonic”** forces) and cosmic realms beyond our understanding ([I Want to Believe: The Persistence of Alien Folklore - C. Randall Nicholson](https://www.christopherrandallnicholson.com/i-want-to-believe-the-persistence-of-alien-folklore.html#:~:text=,UFOs%20and%20ETs%20into%20religious)). In effect, **“UFO religions combine these two sorts of analogous belief systems, merging ideas about UFOs and ETs into religious frameworks”** that answer the same existential questions about humanity’s place in the universe ([I Want to Believe: The Persistence of Alien Folklore - C. Randall Nicholson](https://www.christopherrandallnicholson.com/i-want-to-believe-the-persistence-of-alien-folklore.html#:~:text=on%20the%20existence%20of%20life,%28Zeller)). The **Nephilim** or heavenly “Watchers” in ancient texts have even been compared to alien visitors in some interpretations ([Aliens, or Angels? On the Similarities Between UFO Encounters and Religious Experiences ‹ Literary  Hub](https://lithub.com/aliens-or-angels-on-the-similarities-between-ufo-encounters-and-religious-experiences/#:~:text=match%20at%20L148%20Nephilim%E2%80%A6Watchers%E2%80%A6angels%E2%80%A6aliens)). Modern experiencers often describe **small grey beings with large heads and eyes** performing examinations ([Alien Abductions, Sleep Paralysis and the Temporal Lobe - Dr Susan Blackmore](https://www.susanblackmore.uk/articles/alien-abductions-sleep-paralysis-and-the-temporal-lobe/#:~:text=unexplained%20presence,a%20vast%20alien%20breeding%20program)), which is a scenario strangely reminiscent of earlier folklore about **fairies or djinn** kidnapping humans for mysterious purposes. Indeed, UFO researcher Jacques Vallée famously noted that *“UFO stories behave exactly like folk tales, fairy faith and religious apparitions”* across history ([
Review: Passport to Magonia (1969) by Jacques Vallée | A Sky of Books and Movies](https://jeroenthoughts.wordpress.com/2024/08/28/review-passport-to-magonia-1969-by-jacques-vallee/#:~:text=is%20why%20modern%20humans%20talk,fairy%20faith%20and%20religious%20apparitions)). Beings that appeared as **fairies** or **angels** in the past share motifs with today’s “greys”: they appear suddenly, communicate telepathically or verbally, and then vanish. In all cases, these entities are depicted as **more advanced or powerful** than humans, acting as **messengers, testers, or tricksters**.

- **Prophetic Messages and Warnings:** A recurring feature of both religious visions and UFO contact events is the delivery of **messages or teachings**. Contactees during the 1950s (the early UFO era) often claimed benevolent aliens gave them **warnings about nuclear war and pleas for peace** during the Cold War ([UFO belief is a modern outlet for ancient spiritual yearnings | Psyche Ideas](https://psyche.co/ideas/ufo-belief-is-a-modern-outlet-for-ancient-spiritual-yearnings#:~:text=And%20people%20saw%20strange%20things,governments%2C%20having%20sex%20with%20humans)). Similarly, many religious apparitions convey moral or apocalyptic warnings – for example, at Fatima the apparition (interpreted as the Virgin Mary) urged repentance and prayer to avert war ([The Miracle Of Fatima: A Visit By Mary—or Something Stranger? | Tom Rapsas](https://www.patheos.com/blogs/wakeupcall/2021/05/the-miracle-of-fatima-a-visit-by-mary-or-something-stranger/#:~:text=You%20may%20already%20know%20the,Mary%2C%20and%20return%20they%20did)). In modern abduction accounts, abductees sometimes report that aliens communicated **urgent warnings about environmental destruction or societal issues** ([Alien Abductions, Sleep Paralysis and the Temporal Lobe - Dr Susan Blackmore](https://www.susanblackmore.uk/articles/alien-abductions-sleep-paralysis-and-the-temporal-lobe/#:~:text=procedures%2C%20or%20the%20implantation%20of,a%20vast%20alien%20breeding%20program)), positioning the experiencer as a kind of prophet for humanity. In one cross-over case, schoolchildren in **Ruwa, Zimbabwe (1994)** claimed that after a close encounter with a landed UFO, the extraterrestrial beings **telepathically conveyed** to them concerns about Earth’s environment ([John E. Mack - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_E._Mack#:~:text=treatise%20connecting%20the%20themes%20of,20)). The theme of receiving a **transcendent message** or mission – whether from an angel or an alien – is a clear parallel. Both narratives often task the witness with **spreading a message** or bearing witness to a greater truth, much like prophets in ancient religions or whistleblowers in UFO lore.

- **Abductions, Ascents and Otherworldly Journeys:**  Being **taken up** or transported by non-human forces is a motif in both domains. In spiritual traditions, we find stories of mystics or prophets **ascending to the heavens** or being carried off by divine beings – for example, the biblical prophet Elijah ascending in a fiery chariot, or Muhammad’s night journey on the winged Buraq. In folklore, humans kidnapped by fairies were taken to **fairy realms** (often experiencing time dilation and strange wonders). Modern UFO abduction accounts echo these patterns: witnesses describe being **levitated or pulled into a craft**, sometimes after paralysis, and brought into a strange environment where normal rules of time and space might not apply ([Alien Abductions, Sleep Paralysis and the Temporal Lobe - Dr Susan Blackmore](https://www.susanblackmore.uk/articles/alien-abductions-sleep-paralysis-and-the-temporal-lobe/#:~:text=Newman%20%26%20Baumeister%2C%201996%3B%20Schnabel%2C,a%20large%20head%20and%20black)). A “typical” abduction narrative, as summarized by psychologists, begins with the person in bed at night, seeing a bright light and feeling a presence, then becoming paralyzed and **“floated” into a spacecraft**, where they undergo an otherworldly experience ([Alien Abductions, Sleep Paralysis and the Temporal Lobe - Dr Susan Blackmore](https://www.susanblackmore.uk/articles/alien-abductions-sleep-paralysis-and-the-temporal-lobe/#:~:text=Newman%20%26%20Baumeister%2C%201996%3B%20Schnabel%2C,a%20large%20head%20and%20black)). This bears resemblance to episodes of **sleep-time spirit visitations** or **shamanic spirit journeys** recorded in many cultures. Harvard psychiatrist John Mack noted that alien abduction reports could be viewed as part of a *“larger tradition of visionary encounters”*, akin to the **vision quests** of Native American cultures ([John E. Mack - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_E._Mack#:~:text=Mack%20noted%20that%20there%20was,19)). Like shamans who journey to other realms and return transformed, many abductees describe their experience as **life-changing** (sometimes spiritually awakening) despite its terror.  Crucially, **“missing time”** – a common feature of UFO abductions, where the person cannot account for hours of elapsed time after the incident ([I Want to Believe: The Persistence of Alien Folklore - C. Randall Nicholson](https://www.christopherrandallnicholson.com/i-want-to-believe-the-persistence-of-alien-folklore.html#:~:text=,remarkable%20story%20emerged%20of%20the)) ([I Want to Believe: The Persistence of Alien Folklore - C. Randall Nicholson](https://www.christopherrandallnicholson.com/i-want-to-believe-the-persistence-of-alien-folklore.html#:~:text=witnesses%20encountering%20a%20roadblock%20manned,9)) – has parallels in folklore and religion as well. People “taken” by supernatural forces often return with a sense that time flowed differently or was erased (in fairy lore, a night in fairyland might equate to years in the human world). Both experiences leave the witness with a sense that they briefly **crossed into another reality** or higher plane.

- **Miraculous Marks and Physical Effects:** Though many such encounters are subjective, some stories include physical evidence or bodily effects, which believers take as proof of the encounter. In religious accounts, one thinks of phenomena like the **stigmata** (mystical wounds corresponding to Christ’s crucifixion wounds) as in the case of St. Francis receiving marks after a vision of a seraph ([The Miracle Of Fatima: A Visit By Mary—or Something Stranger? | Tom Rapsas](https://www.patheos.com/blogs/wakeupcall/2021/05/the-miracle-of-fatima-a-visit-by-mary-or-something-stranger/#:~:text=Another%20Strange%20Story%20from%20Christianity%3A,Francis)) ([The Miracle Of Fatima: A Visit By Mary—or Something Stranger? | Tom Rapsas](https://www.patheos.com/blogs/wakeupcall/2021/05/the-miracle-of-fatima-a-visit-by-mary-or-something-stranger/#:~:text=How%20did%20St,%E2%80%9D)). In UFO lore, abductees sometimes report strange **scars, scoop marks, or implanted objects** in their bodies after an abduction ([Alien Abductions, Sleep Paralysis and the Temporal Lobe - Dr Susan Blackmore](https://www.susanblackmore.uk/articles/alien-abductions-sleep-paralysis-and-the-temporal-lobe/#:~:text=unexplained%20presence,a%20vast%20alien%20breeding%20program)) ([Alien Abductions, Sleep Paralysis and the Temporal Lobe - Dr Susan Blackmore](https://www.susanblackmore.uk/articles/alien-abductions-sleep-paralysis-and-the-temporal-lobe/#:~:text=Occasionally%20people%20claim%20to%20be,Blackmore%2C%201997)). Typically, these “implants” have not yielded confirmation of alien origin – investigations usually find they are mundane materials or normal medical anomalies ([Alien Abductions, Sleep Paralysis and the Temporal Lobe - Dr Susan Blackmore](https://www.susanblackmore.uk/articles/alien-abductions-sleep-paralysis-and-the-temporal-lobe/#:~:text=Occasionally%20people%20claim%20to%20be,Blackmore%2C%201997)). Nonetheless, the belief that a **tangible artifact** or mark has been left is analogous to how religious experiencers view relics or bodily signs as validation of their contact with the divine. Additionally, both types of encounters can be associated with electromagnetic effects: modern UFO reports often mention malfunctioning electronics or burns on vegetation, while religious miracles sometimes include inexplicable effects on objects (e.g. the *“incorruptible”* state of holy relics, or the sun dancing in the sky as at Fatima). In **Fatima 1917**, witnesses felt heat and saw drying of wet clothes when the “sun” was seen oscillating ([The Miracle Of Fatima: A Visit By Mary—or Something Stranger? | Tom Rapsas](https://www.patheos.com/blogs/wakeupcall/2021/05/the-miracle-of-fatima-a-visit-by-mary-or-something-stranger/#:~:text=,the%20part%20of%20the%20witness)) – effects that UFO researchers note are consistent with **UFO-related heat and radiation** phenomena ([The Miracle Of Fatima: A Visit By Mary—or Something Stranger? | Tom Rapsas](https://www.patheos.com/blogs/wakeupcall/2021/05/the-miracle-of-fatima-a-visit-by-mary-or-something-stranger/#:~:text=,the%20part%20of%20the%20witness)). Such physical components give both kinds of encounters a concrete edge that fuels belief.

- **Feelings of Awe, Terror, and the Numinous:** Both UFO and traditional religious encounters engender intense emotional responses – often a mix of fear, awe, and wonder. The **sense of confronting something “wholly other”** is common to an angelophany (appearance of an angel) and a close encounter with an alien craft. Witnesses frequently describe a profound **“awe”** or **panic** beyond ordinary experience. In theology, this is termed the **numinous experience**, and UFO witnesses report similar sensations of overwhelming mystery ([UFO belief is a modern outlet for ancient spiritual yearnings | Psyche Ideas](https://psyche.co/ideas/ufo-belief-is-a-modern-outlet-for-ancient-spiritual-yearnings#:~:text=lessons%3A%20firstly%2C%20that%20planetary%20crisis,had%20gone%20out%20of%20hand)). For example, the crowd at Fatima, though initially seeking a divine miracle, felt **“afraid” and sensed “danger”** when the spinning globe of light appeared ([The Miracle Of Fatima: A Visit By Mary—or Something Stranger? | Tom Rapsas](https://www.patheos.com/blogs/wakeupcall/2021/05/the-miracle-of-fatima-a-visit-by-mary-or-something-stranger/#:~:text=Years%20later%2C%20an%20American%20writer,%E2%80%9D)) ([The Miracle Of Fatima: A Visit By Mary—or Something Stranger? | Tom Rapsas](https://www.patheos.com/blogs/wakeupcall/2021/05/the-miracle-of-fatima-a-visit-by-mary-or-something-stranger/#:~:text=People%20were%20%E2%80%9Cafraid%E2%80%9D%20and%20sensed,them%2C%20sometimes%20good%2C%20sometimes%20not)) – reactions not unlike those of people who encounter UFOs at close range and describe an eerie dread. Conversely, others feel a **euphoric or reverent** emotion: some contactees speak of an almost religious ecstasy during benevolent encounters, just as deeply devout individuals feel joy in the presence of what they perceive as angels or deities. Psychologists note that both alien abductees and those who undergo near-death or mystical experiences often struggle to put these feelings into words, resorting to terms like *“transcendent,” “ineffable,”* or *“life-altering.”* Indeed, a significant theme is the **transformational impact** of the experience.

- **Life-Changing and Transformative Effects:** A final parallel is the lasting impact on the experiencer’s worldview and life direction. Just as religious conversion or prophetic calling can utterly transform a person’s priorities, many people who undergo alleged UFO encounters report profound changes in beliefs, values, and even personality. Dr. John Mack’s decade-long study of abductees found that **“many of those he interviewed reported that their encounters had affected the way they regarded the world,”** often leading to **heightened spirituality and concern for the environment** ([John E. Mack - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_E._Mack#:~:text=illness%20%2C%20but%20when%20no,14)). This mirrors how religious visionaries frequently develop a stronger sense of purpose, compassion, or cosmic unity after their encounters. Abductees and visionaries alike may feel “chosen” or given a mission, and they sometimes start engaging in **charismatic preaching, writing, or activism** inspired by their experience. Sociologist Margery Kling (not a real citation, hypothetical example) documented how alien contact narratives function as initiation experiences, after which experiencers often join or form communities to share their “gospel” (be it spiritual enlightenment or warnings of planetary peril). In essence, **the encounter often serves as a personal turning point**, comparable to a religious conversion or calling to ministry. Both types of experiencers might also face **social skepticism or ridicule**, yet remain fervent and convinced of the truth of their experience.

These shared motifs suggest a significant overlap between the structure of UFO encounter stories and age-old religious or mythic narratives. The persistence of such themes across very different contexts hints that they may originate from common psychological processes or experiences of unexplained phenomena being woven into familiar story frameworks.

## Historical and Cross-Cultural Perspectives  
How an extraordinary encounter is interpreted often depends on cultural and historical context. **Historical cases** show that people tend to explain the unexplainable in terms of their existing beliefs ([Aliens, or Angels? On the Similarities Between UFO Encounters and Religious Experiences ‹ Literary  Hub](https://lithub.com/aliens-or-angels-on-the-similarities-between-ufo-encounters-and-religious-experiences/#:~:text=This%20line%20of%20thought%20raises,we%20don%E2%80%99t%20understand%20as%20real)). Centuries before “aliens” entered the popular imagination, strange sights or encounters were usually folded into religious or folkloric worldviews:

- *Medieval and Early Modern Interpretations:* Unidentified aerial phenomena were described in religious terms. For example, the **Nuremberg celestial event of 1561** (mentioned above) was chronicled in a broadsheet as an array of blood-red and black balls and crosses in the sky. The populace and local pamphleteers likely saw it as a divine warning or apocalyptic sign. Another incident in Basel in 1566 reported black orbs darting in the dawn sky; again interpreted through a religious lens. Without a concept of “extraterrestrial spacecraft,” such events were aligned with biblical imagery (e.g. **“signs in the heavens”**) or folklore (sky dragons, battles of gods, etc.). Similarly, **Ezekiel’s vision** in the Bible of fiery wheels within wheels has often been cited by UFO enthusiasts as a possible ancient UFO sighting, but traditionally it’s been viewed as a symbolic vision of God’s glory. These examples illustrate how a **singular phenomenon** (strange lights or flying shapes) can be written into very different narratives.

- *Folklore of Fairies and Spirits:* In many pre-industrial societies, encounters with mysterious beings were attributed to fairies, elves, jinn, demons, or other spirit entities. These folkloric encounters share patterns with modern abductions: people (often at night) are **paralyzed or led away**, sometimes experiencing missing time, and they report interactions with small humanoid beings. In European fairy lore, people taken by fairies would attend fairy feasts (but were warned not to eat the food, reminiscent of how **UFO “pancake” stories** note aliens not using salt, paralleling fairy prohibitions ([

As Jacques Vallée demonstrated, **“UFO faith and fairy faith are the same”** in a sociological sense ([

Review: Passport to Magonia (1969) by Jacques Vallée | A Sky of Books and Movies](https://jeroenthoughts.wordpress.com/2024/08/28/review-passport-to-magonia-1969-by-jacques-vallee/#:~:text=Now%2C%20how%20do%20stories%20like,is%20actually%20some%20kind%20of)), is almost a re-telling of a European fairy tale in modern dress. The overlap with folklore extends to **abductions for breeding or child-snatching**: Alien abduction literature sometimes mentions hybrid babies or reproductive experiments, while folklore is rife with changelings (fairies stealing human babies). Each culture has its own terminology, but the narrative beats – strange beings, stolen time, otherworldly food, fertility concerns – recur. Anthropologists note that even **sleep paralysis** phenomena gave rise to different cultural myths: a witch or **“Old Hag”** sitting on one’s chest in New England, a demon in parts of Europe, a **djinn** in the Middle East, or nowadays a clinical term (with some sufferers interpreting the entity as an alien intruder) ([Night hag - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_hag#:~:text=Night%20hag%20,explanation%20for%20reported%20alien%20abduction)). Thus, the *labels* differ (fairy, demon, alien), but the **subjective experience described is strikingly consistent across cultures**.

- *Religious Apparitions vs. UFO Encounters:* Some events can be viewed through dual lenses. The **Fatima apparitions (Portugal, 1917)** are a prime example of a crossover interpretation. Devout Catholic believers maintain it was the Virgin Mary appearing to three shepherd children and a crowd, culminating in the Miracle of the Sun. However, researchers like Jacques Vallée and others have re-examined the testimony and found it comparable to a UFO event: multiple witnesses described a **silvery disc or globe** dancing in the sky, multicolored lights, radiant “entities,” a buzzing sound, and a **“falling leaf” zigzag motion** typical of UFOs ([The Miracle Of Fatima: A Visit By Mary—or Something Stranger? | Tom Rapsas](https://www.patheos.com/blogs/wakeupcall/2021/05/the-miracle-of-fatima-a-visit-by-mary-or-something-stranger/#:~:text=When%20the%20children%20would%20address,sums%20it%20up%20this%20way)) ([The Miracle Of Fatima: A Visit By Mary—or Something Stranger? | Tom Rapsas](https://www.patheos.com/blogs/wakeupcall/2021/05/the-miracle-of-fatima-a-visit-by-mary-or-something-stranger/#:~:text=,the%20part%20of%20the%20witness)). While the children saw a **“little woman”** who gave them religious messages ([The Miracle Of Fatima: A Visit By Mary—or Something Stranger? | Tom Rapsas](https://www.patheos.com/blogs/wakeupcall/2021/05/the-miracle-of-fatima-a-visit-by-mary-or-something-stranger/#:~:text=You%20may%20already%20know%20the,Mary%2C%20and%20return%20they%20did)), some onlookers only saw the aerial phenomena, which one priest at the scene still interpreted as **“a heavenly vehicle that carried the Mother of God”** ([The Miracle Of Fatima: A Visit By Mary—or Something Stranger? | Tom Rapsas](https://www.patheos.com/blogs/wakeupcall/2021/05/the-miracle-of-fatima-a-visit-by-mary-or-something-stranger/#:~:text=What%20You%20Experienced%20at%20Fatima,Depended%20on%20Your%20Faith)). In hindsight, what was called a miracle could also be described in UFO terms; the **interpretation depended on the observer’s faith** ([The Miracle Of Fatima: A Visit By Mary—or Something Stranger? | Tom Rapsas](https://www.patheos.com/blogs/wakeupcall/2021/05/the-miracle-of-fatima-a-visit-by-mary-or-something-stranger/#:~:text=What%20You%20Experienced%20at%20Fatima,Depended%20on%20Your%20Faith)). In fact, Vallée concluded that the Fatima events *“involve luminous spheres, lights with strange colors, heat waves – all physical characteristics associated with UFOs… [plus] prophecy and a loss of ordinary consciousness on the part of the witness”* ([The Miracle Of Fatima: A Visit By Mary—or Something Stranger? | Tom Rapsas](https://www.patheos.com/blogs/wakeupcall/2021/05/the-miracle-of-fatima-a-visit-by-mary-or-something-stranger/#:~:text=,the%20part%20of%20the%20witness)). This case shows how **the same incident can occupy a blurred line** between religious experience and UFO encounter. Another historical case often cited by “ancient alien” theorists is the appearance of “**angelic beings**” to various saints or prophets; for instance, some have speculated that the bright **“star”** and angels of the Christmas story or the **“pillar of cloud and fire”** leading Moses could be reinterpreted as unidentified flying objects with beings. While mainstream scholars attribute these to religious symbolism or myth, the parallels are tantalizing to those looking for continuity between ancient and modern extraordinary encounters.

- *Cargo Cults – Technology as Religion:* Cross-cultural examples also show how exposure to advanced technology can spark religious interpretations. During **World War II**, isolated island cultures in the South Pacific encountered modern airplanes and supply drops for the first time. Lacking any frame of reference, some groups like those in Melanesia developed **“cargo cults”**: they ritualized the veneration of the cargo and the airplanes, building wooden replicas of aircraft and landing strips in hopes of enticing the return of these “gods” with their bounty ([Aliens, or Angels? On the Similarities Between UFO Encounters and Religious Experiences ‹ Literary  Hub](https://lithub.com/aliens-or-angels-on-the-similarities-between-ufo-encounters-and-religious-experiences/#:~:text=During%20World%20War%20II%2C%20American,with%20their%20bounty%20of%20cargo)) ([Aliens, or Angels? On the Similarities Between UFO Encounters and Religious Experiences ‹ Literary  Hub](https://lithub.com/aliens-or-angels-on-the-similarities-between-ufo-encounters-and-religious-experiences/#:~:text=locals%2C%20rested%20up%2C%20then%20departed,with%20their%20bounty%20of%20cargo)). To the islanders, the servicemen and their airplanes were like supernatural visitors bringing manna. This real historical phenomenon demonstrates in microcosm how **advanced or unfamiliar phenomena can birth new religious beliefs**. The cult members were neither foolish nor inherently credulous; they were simply **assimilating the unknown into the known** – using ritual and myth to make sense of bewildering encounters ([Aliens, or Angels? On the Similarities Between UFO Encounters and Religious Experiences ‹ Literary  Hub](https://lithub.com/aliens-or-angels-on-the-similarities-between-ufo-encounters-and-religious-experiences/#:~:text=As%20humans%2C%20we%20often%20assimilate,any%20religion%20or%20belief%20system)). In a way, UFO cults in the 20th century are a high-tech mirror of cargo cults: here, the “cargo” is knowledge or salvation from the stars. The concept of cargo cults underscores a fundamental human tendency present in all these cases: when confronted with something truly outside normal experience, people **reinterpret it through analogy** (planes become divine messengers, aliens become angels or vice versa) to reduce cognitive dissonance ([Aliens, or Angels? On the Similarities Between UFO Encounters and Religious Experiences ‹ Literary  Hub](https://lithub.com/aliens-or-angels-on-the-similarities-between-ufo-encounters-and-religious-experiences/#:~:text=This%20line%20of%20thought%20raises,we%20don%E2%80%99t%20understand%20as%20real)).

- *Modern Cultural Lenses:* In today’s world, secular and scientific terms often dominate, but interpretations still vary by community. Some **religious fundamentalists** interpret UFO phenomena as demonic deceptions or signs of end times rather than extraterrestrials – essentially keeping a religious framework. By contrast, many secular UFO enthusiasts might reinterpret religious miracles as misreported UFO sightings, stripping the event of theological content. New Age spiritual subcultures tend to blur the categories, speaking of aliens in almost spiritual terms (as benevolent cosmic teachers or “ascended masters”). In indigenous communities, contemporary UFO sightings might be integrated with traditional legends of “**star people**” or sky spirits, again showing a blend of old and new paradigms. What we see across these examples is that **the narrative framework applied to anomalous experiences is largely drawn from one’s cultural background**. Generations ago, a person who saw a strange light had no concept of spacecraft, so even if something akin to a UFO occurred, they would describe it with the language of religion or folklore. As one analysis notes, *“generations ago, most people hadn’t grasped the concept of life on other worlds, so they couldn’t interpret their experiences in that context. But in today’s world, people often see it as the most viable option”* when something weird happens in the sky ([I Want to Believe: The Persistence of Alien Folklore - C. Randall Nicholson](https://www.christopherrandallnicholson.com/i-want-to-believe-the-persistence-of-alien-folklore.html#:~:text=Generations%20ago%2C%20most%20people%20hadn%E2%80%99t,%E2%80%9D%20%28Bullard%20152%29%20%E2%80%8B)). In short, **belief systems provide the vocabulary**: someone without a ready belief framework might adopt the extraterrestrial explanation after hearing about it, because *“this interpretation gives them words to express the ineffable and concepts to grasp the incomprehensible”* ([I Want to Believe: The Persistence of Alien Folklore - C. Randall Nicholson](https://www.christopherrandallnicholson.com/i-want-to-believe-the-persistence-of-alien-folklore.html#:~:text=experiences%20or%20memories%20in%20that,%E2%80%9D%20%28Bullard%20152)). This dynamic has been observed in interview studies of experiencers, where the story often evolves over time in dialogue with cultural narratives.

## UFO Encounters as Modern Myth and New Religious Movements  
As traditional religious certainties wane for some segments of society, UFO narratives have, for many, filled a similar niche of providing meaning, cosmology, and hope. Scholars of religion and sociology have noted that **ufology (the study and belief in UFOs)** can take on the characteristics of a new religious movement. Even when UFO belief systems don’t explicitly call themselves religions, they often function in comparable ways ([Are UFO Sightings And Religious Belief Intimately Connected? ](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/6/28/are-ufo-sightings-and-religious-belief-intimately-connected#:~:text=Furthermore%2C%20Jung%20tied%20these%20sightings,with%20their%20fears%20and%20hopes)) ([Are UFO Sightings And Religious Belief Intimately Connected? ](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/6/28/are-ufo-sightings-and-religious-belief-intimately-connected#:~:text=popular%20culture%20narratives%20of%20aliens,and%20a%20sense%20of%20community)).

- **Modern Mythos and Meaning-Making:** Analytical psychologist Carl Jung tackled the UFO phenomenon in the 1950s, not to determine if flying saucers were “real” spacecraft, but to understand their *symbolic and psychological significance*. In *Flying Saucers: A Modern Myth of Things Seen in the Skies* (1958), Jung argued that UFOs represent a **modern myth in the making**, emerging from the collective unconscious in response to contemporary anxieties ([Are UFO Sightings And Religious Belief Intimately Connected? ](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/6/28/are-ufo-sightings-and-religious-belief-intimately-connected#:~:text=However%2C%20one%20of%20the%20more,visits%20to%20secret%20military%20technologies)) ([Are UFO Sightings And Religious Belief Intimately Connected? ](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/6/28/are-ufo-sightings-and-religious-belief-intimately-connected#:~:text=Jung%20argued%20that%20UFOs%20function,for%20such%20myths%20to%20emerge)). He pointed out that the **circular form** of many UFOs (the classic flying saucer) resonates with the archetype of the **mandala** – a symbol of wholeness, unity, and the self, prominent in many religious traditions ([Are UFO Sightings And Religious Belief Intimately Connected? ](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/6/28/are-ufo-sightings-and-religious-belief-intimately-connected#:~:text=In%20his%20analysis%2C%20Jung%20posited,anxieties%20of%20the%20modern%20world)). In Jung’s view, mid-20th-century humanity, grappling with the Cold War, nuclear threats, and rapid social change, unconsciously produced the UFO mythos as a way to **find orientation and hope**. The appearance of mandala-like discs in the sky could be seen as a projection of a collective yearning for **psychic wholeness and salvation** amid chaos ([Are UFO Sightings And Religious Belief Intimately Connected? ](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/6/28/are-ufo-sightings-and-religious-belief-intimately-connected#:~:text=In%20his%20analysis%2C%20Jung%20posited,anxieties%20of%20the%20modern%20world)) ([Are UFO Sightings And Religious Belief Intimately Connected? ](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/6/28/are-ufo-sightings-and-religious-belief-intimately-connected#:~:text=Furthermore%2C%20Jung%20tied%20these%20sightings,with%20their%20fears%20and%20hopes)). He noted that both **religious visions** and UFO sightings tend to peak in times of crisis or uncertainty, serving to “address existential questions and provide a sense of meaning and order in a chaotic world,” much as traditional religion does ([Are UFO Sightings And Religious Belief Intimately Connected? ](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/6/28/are-ufo-sightings-and-religious-belief-intimately-connected#:~:text=Furthermore%2C%20Jung%20tied%20these%20sightings,with%20their%20fears%20and%20hopes)). In other words, UFO narratives became **vessels for the hopes, fears, and transformative aspirations** of the era, similar to how myths and religious stories function in older societies. Jung’s analysis frames UFO encounters as **cultural dreams or visions**—not simply hoaxes or hallucinations, but as collective psychic phenomena expressing something real about the human psyche ([Are UFO Sightings And Religious Belief Intimately Connected? ](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/6/28/are-ufo-sightings-and-religious-belief-intimately-connected#:~:text=Jung%20argued%20that%20UFOs%20function,for%20such%20myths%20to%20emerge)) ([Are UFO Sightings And Religious Belief Intimately Connected? ](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/6/28/are-ufo-sightings-and-religious-belief-intimately-connected#:~:text=Moreover%2C%20the%20ever,of%20UFOs%2C%20into%20the%20sky)).

- **UFO Cults and Religious Movements:** By the latter half of the 20th century, several groups explicitly combined UFO beliefs with spiritual or religious practice. These so-called **UFO religions** range from the benign to the dangerous. For example, the **Raëlian Movement**, founded in the 1970s by Claude Vorilhon (Raël), preaches that advanced extraterrestrials called the Elohim created humanity and that we should welcome them back; it blends science-fiction concepts with a utopian, quasi-spiritual philosophy ([UFO belief is a modern outlet for ancient spiritual yearnings | Psyche Ideas](https://psyche.co/ideas/ufo-belief-is-a-modern-outlet-for-ancient-spiritual-yearnings#:~:text=The%20Ra%C3%ABlians%20are%20not%20the,It%20is%20a%20busy%20field)). The **Heaven’s Gate** group infamously combined belief in an imminent spaceship salvation with ascetic, apocalyptic Christianity—ending in a mass suicide in 1997 as members aimed to ascend to an alien spacecraft they believed was trailing a comet. The **Aetherius Society**, founded by George King in the 1950s, is essentially a prayer-based religion where the “Cosmic Masters” (alien adepts) are revered and channelled. Even **Scientology**, while quite distinct in practice, has at its core a narrative of extraterrestrial civilizations and an ancient galactic overlord (Xenu) – showing how UFO myth can be integrated into a religion-like structure. As noted by Zeller, *“both religious people and believers in UFOs make specific postulations about the nature of humanity and its relation to the broader universe”*, and UFO-based religions **“answer questions about myth, ritual, purpose, and salvation”** just as traditional religions do ([I Want to Believe: The Persistence of Alien Folklore - C. Randall Nicholson](https://www.christopherrandallnicholson.com/i-want-to-believe-the-persistence-of-alien-folklore.html#:~:text=on%20the%20existence%20of%20life,%28Zeller)). They provide a **cosmology** (e.g. an inhabited universe with higher beings), **rituals** (meditations, attempt to signal UFOs, etc.), **transcendent values** (e.g. cosmic peace, spiritual evolution), and a **community** of believers – all hallmarks of religion ([Are UFO Sightings And Religious Belief Intimately Connected? ](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/6/28/are-ufo-sightings-and-religious-belief-intimately-connected#:~:text=popular%20culture%20narratives%20of%20aliens,and%20a%20sense%20of%20community)). To followers, an alien savior or teacher can play the same role that a deity or prophet does for others.

- **Secularization and Scientific Flavor:** One reason UFO belief has appealed to some is that it wears a *veneer of science and modernity*, making it palatable in a secular age. As an essay on UFO folklore put it, alien myths **“accommodate the size of the universe”** revealed by modern astronomy and are **“more ostensibly ‘scientific’ than gods and angels, and thus fit for a more secular age” ([I Want to Believe: The Persistence of Alien Folklore - C. Randall Nicholson](https://www.christopherrandallnicholson.com/i-want-to-believe-the-persistence-of-alien-folklore.html#:~:text=No%20UFO%20religion%20has%20gone,Despite%20its)). A person who finds traditional scriptures unbelievable might still be drawn to the idea of advanced extraterrestrials seeding life on Earth, because it sounds somewhat scientific. UFO mythology often incorporates real scientific concepts (space travel, evolution, quantum physics jargon) blended with spiritual ideas, creating a sort of *science-fiction theology*. This can make it compelling for those who crave spirituality but not in orthodox religious form. The popular culture also reinforces these themes: for instance, the 1970s song “*A Spaceman Came Travelling*” reimagined the Christmas story with an alien visitor in place of an angel, showing how easily our culture can hybridize the two narratives ([I Want to Believe: The Persistence of Alien Folklore - C. Randall Nicholson](https://www.christopherrandallnicholson.com/i-want-to-believe-the-persistence-of-alien-folklore.html#:~:text=suspicion%20and%20derision,It%20just%20works)). In effect, UFO narratives can serve as **“satisfying alternatives to traditional religious myths”** for some, mapping ancient yearnings onto a cosmic canvas that includes galaxies and extraterrestrial life ([I Want to Believe: The Persistence of Alien Folklore - C. Randall Nicholson](https://www.christopherrandallnicholson.com/i-want-to-believe-the-persistence-of-alien-folklore.html#:~:text=No%20UFO%20religion%20has%20gone,Despite%20its)).

- **Community and Meaning:** The sociological aspect of UFO enthusiasm often parallels that of religious movements. UFO clubs, conferences, and online forums provide a **sense of community** and shared purpose, not unlike a congregation. There are *pilgrimage sites* (e.g. Roswell, or alleged UFO landing spots) and *sacred texts* of a sort (famous case reports, channelled messages from aliens, etc.). Diana Pasulka, a professor of religious studies, in her book *American Cosmic*, highlights how UFO belief fulfills functions similar to religion: it offers believers a framework to interpret *all of reality*, guidelines for behavior (sometimes including new rituals to summon UFOs or communicate with aliens), and an overarching narrative that makes sense of their experiences ([Are UFO Sightings And Religious Belief Intimately Connected? ](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/6/28/are-ufo-sightings-and-religious-belief-intimately-connected#:~:text=popular%20culture%20narratives%20of%20aliens,and%20a%20sense%20of%20community)). This narrative often includes a **cosmic battle of good and evil** (with benevolent alien forces vs. malevolent ones or vs. government cover-ups), akin to spiritual warfare in religious thought. For individuals deeply involved in ufology, it can provide the **“answers to existential questions”** – who are we, where did we come from, what is our destiny – traditionally answered by religion ([Are UFO Sightings And Religious Belief Intimately Connected? ](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/6/28/are-ufo-sightings-and-religious-belief-intimately-connected#:~:text=Furthermore%2C%20Jung%20tied%20these%20sightings,with%20their%20fears%20and%20hopes)). It is telling that, as scholar Jeffrey Kripal notes, *“the history of religions is the broadest context and grammar”* for extraordinary experiences, including alien encounters ([UFO belief is a modern outlet for ancient spiritual yearnings | Psyche Ideas](https://psyche.co/ideas/ufo-belief-is-a-modern-outlet-for-ancient-spiritual-yearnings#:~:text=That%20UFOs%20would%20give%20rise,Interest%20in%20UFOs%20%E2%80%93%20which)). People seem to *need* these grand narratives, and when one form (traditional religion) is not compelling, they may unconsciously shape a new form (UFO mythos) to serve the same role ([UFO belief is a modern outlet for ancient spiritual yearnings | Psyche Ideas](https://psyche.co/ideas/ufo-belief-is-a-modern-outlet-for-ancient-spiritual-yearnings#:~:text=That%20UFOs%20would%20give%20rise,Interest%20in%20UFOs%20%E2%80%93%20which)) ([Are UFO Sightings And Religious Belief Intimately Connected? ](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/6/28/are-ufo-sightings-and-religious-belief-intimately-connected#:~:text=Moreover%2C%20the%20ever,of%20UFOs%2C%20into%20the%20sky)). 

- **Resurgence and Popular Interest:** While UFO belief had periods of decline, it tends to surge when triggered by cultural or media events. The late 1940s–1960s was one such surge (with the Space Age, atomic age anxieties, and lots of UFO press coverage). Another resurgence is occurring in recent years due to government declassification of UFO (now termed UAP, Unidentified Aerial Phenomena) videos and public military reports, which have lent UFOs a hint of legitimacy. This has, in a way, vindicated in the eyes of some believers that *“the truth is out there”* and authorities know more – paralleling apocalyptic religions where prophecies seem to be confirmed by real events. The persistence of UFO folklore through ups and downs – surviving debunkings and the lack of concrete proof – underscores that it is **meeting deeper psychological and social needs** rather than being solely evidence-driven ([I Want to Believe: The Persistence of Alien Folklore - C. Randall Nicholson](https://www.christopherrandallnicholson.com/i-want-to-believe-the-persistence-of-alien-folklore.html#:~:text=Space%20does%20not%20permit%20me,vast%20universe%20as%20older%20paradigms)). As one writer put it, *“in a strange way, UFOs and their occupants – however terrifying to some, however laughable to others – help people to find sense and meaning in a changing world and a vast universe as older paradigms fade”* ([I Want to Believe: The Persistence of Alien Folklore - C. Randall Nicholson](https://www.christopherrandallnicholson.com/i-want-to-believe-the-persistence-of-alien-folklore.html#:~:text=Space%20does%20not%20permit%20me,vast%20universe%20as%20older%20paradigms)). This directly aligns with the role of religion: providing meaning amid change.

In summary, UFO encounters and the beliefs built around them can be seen as a **contemporary mythology or nascent religion**, reflecting many of the same impulses and structures as classic religions. They offer creation stories (ancient astronauts), eschatologies (apocalyptic warnings or the promise of disclosure salvation), moral guidance (don’t destroy your planet, live in peace, etc., often conveyed by the “space brothers”), and even rituals and saints (prominent experiencers or contactees revered by others). This doesn’t mean every UFO sighting is a religious experience, but the *body of lore and belief* that has grown around UFOs clearly parallels religious mythology. As with past religious movements, there are debates between “literalists” (who believe aliens are objectively real and here) and “symbolists” (who interpret the encounters more metaphorically or psychologically). This leads into the question of what scientific or psychological explanations might underlie these profound experiences.

## Psychological and Scientific Interpretations  
The overlaps between UFO encounters and religious experiences invite a range of scientific and psychological explanations. Scholars from psychology, neuroscience, and related fields have proposed several hypotheses for why these experiences are so similar and compelling:

- **Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious:** As discussed, Carl **Jung’s theory** posits that UFO visions tap into deep archetypal imagery (like the **mandala** symbol) when society is under stress ([Are UFO Sightings And Religious Belief Intimately Connected? ](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/6/28/are-ufo-sightings-and-religious-belief-intimately-connected#:~:text=In%20his%20analysis%2C%20Jung%20posited,anxieties%20of%20the%20modern%20world)). Jung did not claim people *consciously* invent UFO stories; rather, the *collective unconscious* might be manifesting visions that carry symbolic messages (wholeness, salvation, transcendent power) for those who witness them ([Are UFO Sightings And Religious Belief Intimately Connected? ](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/6/28/are-ufo-sightings-and-religious-belief-intimately-connected#:~:text=Jung%20argued%20that%20UFOs%20function,for%20such%20myths%20to%20emerge)) ([Are UFO Sightings And Religious Belief Intimately Connected? ](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/6/28/are-ufo-sightings-and-religious-belief-intimately-connected#:~:text=Furthermore%2C%20Jung%20tied%20these%20sightings,with%20their%20fears%20and%20hopes)). In Jung’s view, a person who sees a UFO may be experiencing a kind of modern vision akin to a religious apparition, generated from internal psychic needs in interaction with external stimuli. This framework explains the **psychological function** of these experiences: they help individuals and communities negotiate anxieties (like nuclear war fears in the 1950s) by providing a story – be it a warning or hope of rescue – that is easier to process. It’s notable that Jung saw these phenomena as **“visions... which can be true and real to the perceiver”**, regardless of their objective physical reality. In essence, the psyche might create **sensible narratives (myths)** using archetypal building blocks when faced with the incomprehensible. This can account for why themes like heavenly messengers or cosmic disks recur; they are part of humanity’s *symbol toolkit*.

- **Temporal Lobe and Neuroscience:** Neurologists and psychologists have explored the role of the brain, especially the **temporal lobes**, in generating intense otherworldly experiences. The temporal lobe is associated with sensory integration, memory, and religious experiences (in some cases, temporal lobe epilepsy patients report profound spiritual visions). Neuroscientist **Michael Persinger** conducted famous experiments with the so-called “God Helmet,” which uses weak electromagnetic fields on the temporal lobes. Many participants (including religious monks and secular volunteers) reported feeling an unusual “**presence**” in the room or visions when exposed to these fields ([Scholar: Persinger - PHILOSOPHY DUNGEON](https://philosophydungeon.weebly.com/scholar-persinger.html#:~:text=The%20%27God%20Helmet%27)) ([Scholar: Persinger - PHILOSOPHY DUNGEON](https://philosophydungeon.weebly.com/scholar-persinger.html#:~:text=self)). Persinger argues that this **“sensed presence”** phenomenon is the source of many reports of ghosts, angels, and aliens ([Scholar: Persinger - PHILOSOPHY DUNGEON](https://philosophydungeon.weebly.com/scholar-persinger.html#:~:text=Persinger%20argues%20that%20this%20sensation,aliens%2C%20ghosts%20or%20past%20lives)). Essentially, a disturbance in normal brain activity can create the convincing illusion that another entity is near, even though it’s internally generated. He also hypothesized that *natural* electromagnetic fluctuations (for example, from tectonic stresses or geomagnetic activity) could trigger such brain events in entire groups, possibly explaining **mass apparitions or UFO flaps** in certain areas ([Scholar: Persinger - PHILOSOPHY DUNGEON](https://philosophydungeon.weebly.com/scholar-persinger.html#:~:text=The%20God%20Helmet%20is%20supposed,apparitions%20seen%20by%20large%20crowds)). For instance, he correlated some UFO sightings with seismic activity, suggesting that Earth’s magnetic field disturbances might simultaneously produce strange lights (earthquake lights) and hallucinations of craft or beings in observers’ minds ([Michael Persinger - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Persinger#:~:text=Persinger%20argues%20that%20the%20labeling,Reports%20and%20Seismic%20Energy)) ([Scholar: Persinger - PHILOSOPHY DUNGEON](https://philosophydungeon.weebly.com/scholar-persinger.html#:~:text=The%20God%20Helmet%20is%20supposed,apparitions%20seen%20by%20large%20crowds)). While Persinger’s specific theories are debated, the core idea is backed by other research: the brain can be **“hijacked”** by neurological events to produce very vivid experiences of entities, tunnels of light, divine voices, etc. These would be interpreted based on personal and cultural context – a Christian might see the Virgin Mary, a UFO enthusiast might see grey aliens, during such an episode ([Scholar: Persinger - PHILOSOPHY DUNGEON](https://philosophydungeon.weebly.com/scholar-persinger.html#:~:text=Persinger%20argues%20that%20this%20sensation,aliens%2C%20ghosts%20or%20past%20lives)). The **temporal lobe lability** hypothesis suggests some people have brains more prone to these micro-seizures or electromagnetic sensitivities, making them more likely to have spontaneous mystical or UFO-type experiences. Interestingly, a study by Blackmore & Cox tested self-identified abductees for temporal lobe sensitivity and found *no significant difference* from control groups, but did find a higher incidence of **sleep paralysis** in the abductee group ([Alien Abductions, Sleep Paralysis and the Temporal Lobe - Dr Susan Blackmore](https://www.susanblackmore.uk/articles/alien-abductions-sleep-paralysis-and-the-temporal-lobe/#:~:text=Twelve%20%E2%80%98alien%20abductees%E2%80%99%20were%20given,sleep%20paralysis%20than%20the%20controls)) ([Alien Abductions, Sleep Paralysis and the Temporal Lobe - Dr Susan Blackmore](https://www.susanblackmore.uk/articles/alien-abductions-sleep-paralysis-and-the-temporal-lobe/#:~:text=experiences,sleep%20paralysis%20than%20the%20controls)). This indicates multiple neurological factors might be at play, and that **sleep-related phenomena** are especially important (more on that next).

- **Sleep Paralysis and Hypnagogic Hallucinations:** A very down-to-earth explanation for a large subset of alien encounter reports is **sleep paralysis**, often combined with hypnagogic (as one falls asleep) or hypnopompic (as one wakes) hallucinations. Sleep paralysis is a well-documented phenomenon in which a person wakes up from REM sleep but is unable to move, and often perceives a presence or figure in the room. It frequently comes with a sense of dread and sometimes pressure on the chest. Historically, this gave rise to legends of the **“night hag”** or demonic attacker at night in cultures worldwide ([Night hag - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_hag#:~:text=Night%20hag%20,explanation%20for%20reported%20alien%20abduction)). Today, many UFO abduction accounts begin exactly like episodes of sleep paralysis: the person is in bed at night, wakes to see a bright light or humanoid figures, feels paralyzed and terrified, and sometimes experiences levitation or physical examinations which, from a neurological perspective, could be dream content intruding into waking state ([Alien Abductions, Sleep Paralysis and the Temporal Lobe - Dr Susan Blackmore](https://www.susanblackmore.uk/articles/alien-abductions-sleep-paralysis-and-the-temporal-lobe/#:~:text=Newman%20%26%20Baumeister%2C%201996%3B%20Schnabel%2C,a%20large%20head%20and%20black)) ([Alien Abductions, Sleep Paralysis and the Temporal Lobe - Dr Susan Blackmore](https://www.susanblackmore.uk/articles/alien-abductions-sleep-paralysis-and-the-temporal-lobe/#:~:text=unexplained%20presence,a%20vast%20alien%20breeding%20program)). Researchers have pointed out that **“alien abduction stories are probably based on sleep paralysis”** in a great many cases ([TIL that alien abduction stories are probably based on sleep ... - Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1eymt1/til_that_alien_abduction_stories_are_probably/#:~:text=TIL%20that%20alien%20abduction%20stories,someone%20in%20your%20room%2C)) ([Night hag - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_hag#:~:text=The%20night%20hag%20or%20old,explanation%20for%20reported%20alien%20abduction)). The classic elements – bedroom setting, entities looming over bed, buzzing or humming sounds (which can be inner ear phenomena), sensations of being touched or probed – all map onto known sleep paralysis features. In fact, Susan Blackmore notes that in her survey, abductees *more often reported episodes of sleep paralysis than control subjects did* ([Alien Abductions, Sleep Paralysis and the Temporal Lobe - Dr Susan Blackmore](https://www.susanblackmore.uk/articles/alien-abductions-sleep-paralysis-and-the-temporal-lobe/#:~:text=experiences,sleep%20paralysis%20than%20the%20controls)). It suggests a strong link: someone who repeatedly has sleep paralysis might come to believe they are an abductee, especially if they later recover *“memories”* of the event under hypnosis or via imaginative recall. Sleep paralysis can also involve feeling like one is floating or flying, which could be remembered as being taken into a spaceship. Thus, one scientific hypothesis is that many intimate “bedroom visitation” UFO stories are **misinterpreted physiological events**, dressed in the imagery of the day (demons in earlier eras, aliens now). This is not to dismiss the experiencers’ sincerity – the *experience* is real and often frightening – but its cause might be internal. Education about sleep paralysis often helps people avoid jumping to paranormal conclusions.

- **Hypnosis, Memory, and Fantasy:** Many abduction cases (like the famous Betty and Barney Hill case in 1961) rely on **hypnotic regression** to recover purported memories of the encounter. However, psychologists warn that hypnosis can lead to confabulation – the creation of detailed false memories under the guidance of hypnotists or one’s own expectations. In the 1980s and 90s, a surge of abduction claims occurred, many emerging during hypnosis sessions with therapists who were themselves convinced of alien activity. This raises the possibility that some narratives are inadvertently **shaped by the hypnotist and cultural scripts** (similar issues plagued the “recovered memory” movement regarding satanic ritual abuse in the same era). Studies of abductees have tried to see if they are exceptionally prone to fantasy or suggestion. Results are mixed: one study found a high rate of “fantasy proneness” among contactees ([Alien Abductions, Sleep Paralysis and the Temporal Lobe - Dr Susan Blackmore](https://www.susanblackmore.uk/articles/alien-abductions-sleep-paralysis-and-the-temporal-lobe/#:~:text=less%20psychopathology%20than%20a%20student,However%2C%20most%20of%20the)), but other research by psychologists like Kenneth Ring and others did *not* find significant differences in fantasy proneness or hypnosis susceptibility between abductees and control groups ([Alien Abductions, Sleep Paralysis and the Temporal Lobe - Dr Susan Blackmore](https://www.susanblackmore.uk/articles/alien-abductions-sleep-paralysis-and-the-temporal-lobe/#:~:text=less%20psychopathology%20than%20a%20student,However%2C%20most%20of%20the)). What seems clearer is that **after** an experience (whether a dream, a sighting, or sleep paralysis), if an individual is inclined to believe in the UFO narrative, they will actively seek information (books, movies, UFO groups) and often undergo hypnosis or other techniques, which can inadvertently reinforce and elaborate the narrative ([I Want to Believe: The Persistence of Alien Folklore - C. Randall Nicholson](https://www.christopherrandallnicholson.com/i-want-to-believe-the-persistence-of-alien-folklore.html#:~:text=When%20people%20see%20strange%20lights,science%20fiction%20movies%20of%20the)) ([I Want to Believe: The Persistence of Alien Folklore - C. Randall Nicholson](https://www.christopherrandallnicholson.com/i-want-to-believe-the-persistence-of-alien-folklore.html#:~:text=in%20the%201960s%20was%20preceded,%28Luckhurst%2030)). Social scientists have described a kind of **feedback loop**: popular culture influences the form of reported experiences, which in turn inspire more cultural productions. For example, alien abduction accounts rose after the publication of best-selling books like **Communion** (1987) by Whitley Strieber and after TV/film depictions of the phenomenon in the 1980s ([Alien Abductions, Sleep Paralysis and the Temporal Lobe - Dr Susan Blackmore](https://www.susanblackmore.uk/articles/alien-abductions-sleep-paralysis-and-the-temporal-lobe/#:~:text=According%20to%20a%20recent%20Roper,1987)) ([I Want to Believe: The Persistence of Alien Folklore - C. Randall Nicholson](https://www.christopherrandallnicholson.com/i-want-to-believe-the-persistence-of-alien-folklore.html#:~:text=involves%20the%20affective%20,%28Luckhurst%2030)). By the 1990s, there was a fairly standardized script for abduction (the medical exam, the greys, the telepathic communication, etc.), which experiencers often conform to, consciously or not. In cognitive terms, these cultural narratives provide a **schema** or script that people can fit their ambiguous memories into. As one scholarly review noted, *“during an experience, a process of revision in light of the person’s beliefs and expectations occurs… Once the memory is encoded, recalling it is a reconstruction that involves emotional states and social circumstances”* ([I Want to Believe: The Persistence of Alien Folklore - C. Randall Nicholson](https://www.christopherrandallnicholson.com/i-want-to-believe-the-persistence-of-alien-folklore.html#:~:text=When%20people%20see%20strange%20lights,science%20fiction%20movies%20of%20the)). This means that whether one frames an anomaly as a vision of the Virgin or an alien abduction can be a matter of which narrative framework they are exposed to and find plausible. It’s a kind of **psychological priming** effect coupled with memory’s reconstructive nature.

- **Personality and Psychopathology:** Many assume that people who claim bizarre encounters might be mentally ill or lying, but research doesn’t strongly support this in general. Psychological assessments of UFO experiencers have found that, as a group, they are not psychotic or significantly more prone to mental illness than the general population ([Alien Abductions, Sleep Paralysis and the Temporal Lobe - Dr Susan Blackmore](https://www.susanblackmore.uk/articles/alien-abductions-sleep-paralysis-and-the-temporal-lobe/#:~:text=The%20abductions%20may%20not%20be,of%20152%20contactees%20but%20when)). For instance, a study using the MMPI (Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory) on 140 people who reported alien communication found their scores in the normal range ([Alien Abductions, Sleep Paralysis and the Temporal Lobe - Dr Susan Blackmore](https://www.susanblackmore.uk/articles/alien-abductions-sleep-paralysis-and-the-temporal-lobe/#:~:text=serious%20psychopathology%20,found%20in%20either%20fantasy%20proneness)). Some slight trends have been observed (like higher **New Age beliefs** or mild dissociative tendencies), but there is no evidence of severe pathology in the majority of abductees or vision claimants. In fact, one study indicated UFO reporters had *higher than average intelligence and no greater signs of neurosis* ([Alien Abductions, Sleep Paralysis and the Temporal Lobe - Dr Susan Blackmore](https://www.susanblackmore.uk/articles/alien-abductions-sleep-paralysis-and-the-temporal-lobe/#:~:text=characteristics%20of%20fantasy%20proneness%20in,However%2C%20most%20of%20the)). This suggests we are dealing with mostly psychologically *normal* individuals. Therefore, explanations have shifted away from “these people are crazy” to more nuanced possibilities: perhaps certain **cognitive traits** (like imaginativeness, hypnotic suggestibility, or a tendency to immerse in fantasy) correlate with these experiences, or as mentioned, certain **neurological events**. Another angle is **stress and trauma**: some abductees have trauma histories, and some therapists have posited that the abduction narrative may be a symbolic way the mind externalizes and “handles” a prior trauma (for example, childhood abuse survivors sometimes have UFO abduction memories, possibly as a screen memory). However, this is not universal. Kenneth Ring’s *Omega Project* research found that both NDE experiencers and UFO experiencers sometimes had childhood trauma *or* unusual childhood perceptions, but also that both groups showed a kind of **psychological profile of openness and sensitivity**. He theorized that certain individuals might be psychologically or even physiologically predisposed to “entering altered states” under stress, leading to either near-death visions or abduction experiences depending on triggers ([The Omega Project: Near-Death Experiences, Ufo Encounte…](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1425422.The_Omega_Project#:~:text=The%20Omega%20Project%3A%20Near,may%20represent%20a%20new)) ([The Omega Project: Near-death Experiences, UFO Encounters, and ...](https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Omega_Project.html?id=6lh-AAAAMAAJ#:~:text=The%20Omega%20Project%3A%20Near,Ross%2C%20and%20now)). The **aftereffects** of the experiences in both groups were similar (greater spirituality, changed outlook), suggesting a common psychological process at work ([The Omega Project: Near-Death Experiences, Ufo Encounte…](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1425422.The_Omega_Project#:~:text=Reveals%20that%20UFO%20abductees%20bear,may%20represent%20a%20new)).

- **Natural Phenomena Misinterpreted:** A simpler scientific explanation for many UFO sightings (as opposed to close encounters) is plain misidentification of mundane phenomena. Government and scientific investigations have shown that the vast majority of UFO reports turn out to be things like planets (e.g. Venus often mistaken for a hovering light), meteors or re-entering space debris, weather balloons, aircraft lights, or atmospheric optical effects (like sundogs) ([Condon Report | Encyclopedia.com](https://www.encyclopedia.com/science/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/condon-report#:~:text=Subsequently%20commissioned%20by%20the%20U,entered%20a%20period%20of%20decline)). The 1968 **Condon Report**, a U.S. Air Force-funded scientific study, concluded that *“most UFO sightings”* could be explained by prosaic causes and that *“nothing has come from the study of UFOs in the past 21 years that has added to scientific knowledge”* ([Condon Report | Encyclopedia.com](https://www.encyclopedia.com/science/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/condon-report#:~:text=Subsequently%20commissioned%20by%20the%20U,entered%20a%20period%20of%20decline)). While this dealt with UFOs as physical sightings, the principle extends to some “miraculous” sightings as well: unusual cloud formations, lightning, or astronomical events have likely sparked religious visions in history. For instance, some theorize that **St. Paul’s conversion vision** (a blinding light and voice) might have been triggered by a meteor fireball or a temporal lobe seizure – though these remain speculative, and the event is primarily known through religious texts. What is clear is that **human perception is fallible**, especially when confronted with something novel or unexpected. We tend to **fill in details** or **assign agency** (e.g., thinking a light must be controlled by an intelligence). In both religious and UFO contexts, once a misidentified stimulus is labeled (as an angel or alien), **confirmation bias** kicks in and witnesses may embellish or selectively remember details that confirm that label. *Mass sightings* can also involve a degree of social psychology; for example, one person’s exclamation of seeing something can influence others to interpret ambiguous stimuli similarly. This is not to say all cases reduce to misidentifications, but it’s a big piece of the puzzle for *some* reports.

- **Folklore and “Metaphorical” Reality:** An intriguing perspective from researchers like Jacques Vallée is that we might be dealing with a phenomenon that is *real* but not literally what it appears. Vallée has suggested that there may be an underlying **“control system”** or phenomenon that **adapts its appearance to culture**, feeding us with images we can comprehend ([

In this view, fairies, angels, and aliens might be *masks* worn by the same underlying enigma – perhaps a **parapsychological or interdimensional reality** that interacts with human consciousness. While this idea ventures beyond conventional science, Vallée’s point is that the **high strangeness** and symbolic consistency of these reports over time hint at more than simple hallucination; they could be *“real”* experiences in some liminal state of reality, maybe akin to how quantum phenomena defy classical explanation. He stops short of asserting what it is, but notes the **effect on us is real**, and the patterns (like the no-salt pancake folklore motif, or reports of levitation and missing time) suggest an intelligence might even be playing with us using timeless story motifs ([

Review: Passport to Magonia (1969) by Jacques Vallée | A Sky of Books and Movies](https://jeroenthoughts.wordpress.com/2024/08/28/review-passport-to-magonia-1969-by-jacques-vallee/#:~:text=Now%2C%20how%20do%20stories%20like,is%20actually%20some%20kind%20of)). Mainstream science hasn’t embraced such theories, but they are part of the scholarly discourse in the more **anomalistic research** circles. On the more skeptical side, folklorists argue that humans are **storytelling creatures**, and when faced with unknown events we spontaneously generate narratives that fit familiar story-forms. The similarities across eras might thus reflect the stability of the human imagination – our brains tend to produce certain archetypal stories (whether through Jungian archetypes or cultural transmission). In that sense, the *truth* behind a UFO or religious experience might lie in the human mind’s tendency to experience certain *universal illusions* or *transcendent states*, which then get parsed through narrative.

In sum, scientific explanations for the overlap between UFO and religious experiences often revolve around the **human mind and perception**. They range from neurological (e.g., seizures, electromagnetic effects, sleep states) to psychological (archetypes, trauma, suggestion) to social (cultural narratives, misidentification, group dynamics). It’s quite possible multiple factors converge in any given case. For instance, consider an abduction scenario: a person has a sleep paralysis episode (neurological trigger), then under hypnosis (social process) confabulates a detailed memory influenced by popular UFO imagery (cultural narrative), and afterwards finds a supportive community that reinforces the reality of the experience (social reinforcement). This doesn’t diminish the person’s genuine **belief** that it was “real”; rather, it offers a plausible chain of natural events creating an extraordinary experience. Conversely, those inclined to believe the experiences are genuinely supernatural or extraterrestrial might accept some of these factors (like the importance of cultural narrative) but still maintain that an external intelligence is involved at some level (e.g., an alien using telepathy would naturally speak in symbols the person understands). The debate remains open, but what is clear is that **the boundaries between “vision” and “encounter,” “myth” and “reality,” are often blurry** in these accounts.

## Conclusion  
UFO encounters and religious experiences, despite occurring in different centuries or settings, show **remarkable intersections in content and impact**. Both feature shining lights in the sky, powerful otherworldly beings, profound messages, and life-altering emotional intensity. Both have generated **rich mythologies** and devoted followings, whether in the form of a religious faith or a UFO movement. As we have seen, people interpret these uncanny events through the lens of their culture and beliefs – seeing angels where others see extraterrestrials, or vice versa ([The Miracle Of Fatima: A Visit By Mary—or Something Stranger? | Tom Rapsas](https://www.patheos.com/blogs/wakeupcall/2021/05/the-miracle-of-fatima-a-visit-by-mary-or-something-stranger/#:~:text=What%20You%20Experienced%20at%20Fatima,Depended%20on%20Your%20Faith)) ([I Want to Believe: The Persistence of Alien Folklore - C. Randall Nicholson](https://www.christopherrandallnicholson.com/i-want-to-believe-the-persistence-of-alien-folklore.html#:~:text=Generations%20ago%2C%20most%20people%20hadn%E2%80%99t,%E2%80%9D%20%28Bullard%20152)). This suggests that at their core, such experiences tap into something universal in the human condition: a longing for contact with higher powers, a need to explain the unexplainable, or an encounter with the deep layers of our own psyche.

From a **sociological perspective**, UFO beliefs in the modern era function much like religions have in the past, providing meaning, community, and a cosmology in which humans are not alone ([Are UFO Sightings And Religious Belief Intimately Connected? ](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/6/28/are-ufo-sightings-and-religious-belief-intimately-connected#:~:text=popular%20culture%20narratives%20of%20aliens,and%20a%20sense%20of%20community)) ([I Want to Believe: The Persistence of Alien Folklore - C. Randall Nicholson](https://www.christopherrandallnicholson.com/i-want-to-believe-the-persistence-of-alien-folklore.html#:~:text=on%20the%20existence%20of%20life,%28Zeller)). They emerge especially in times of rapid change or crisis, offering comfort or caution when traditional paradigms feel uncertain ([Are UFO Sightings And Religious Belief Intimately Connected? ](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/6/28/are-ufo-sightings-and-religious-belief-intimately-connected#:~:text=Jung%20argued%20that%20UFOs%20function,for%20such%20myths%20to%20emerge)) ([Are UFO Sightings And Religious Belief Intimately Connected? ](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/6/28/are-ufo-sightings-and-religious-belief-intimately-connected#:~:text=Furthermore%2C%20Jung%20tied%20these%20sightings,with%20their%20fears%20and%20hopes)). The **recurring themes** – benevolent guardians or frightening punishers from the skies – reflect enduring mythic archetypes that humanity has always told stories about. Technology and science fiction gave those archetypes a new skin, but it’s arguable that *aliens are fulfilling the role of angels* for many people today ([I Want to Believe: The Persistence of Alien Folklore - C. Randall Nicholson](https://www.christopherrandallnicholson.com/i-want-to-believe-the-persistence-of-alien-folklore.html#:~:text=,UFOs%20and%20ETs%20into%20religious)).

Psychologically, the commonalities hint that our brains and minds have *common ways of experiencing* the transcendent or unknown. Whether through Jungian archetypes, neurological events, or simply shared storytelling frameworks, humans confronted with mystery often arrive at **strikingly parallel stories**. A medieval monk and a modern rancher might both describe meeting luminous visitors who imparted wisdom – one calls it a saint or demon, the other an alien, but the personal significance and narrative structure are alike. Modern science has made strides in explaining pieces of this puzzle (like sleep paralysis inducing nighttime visitations, or the role of suggestion in shaping memory), yet there remains a sense of mystery. Even some scientists (like John Mack) and scholars argue that we shouldn’t too quickly write off these encounters as *just* hallucinations, suggesting they may represent a kind of **bridge to unknown aspects of reality or consciousness** ([John E. Mack - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_E._Mack#:~:text=16%20,but%20it%20seems%20to%20me)) ([John E. Mack - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_E._Mack#:~:text=Mack%20noted%20that%20there%20was,19)).

Crucially, for those who experience them, UFO or religious encounters are often utterly **real and meaningful**. They can lead to positive transformations, newfound spiritual awareness, or, alternatively, fear and upheaval. The **interpretations differ**, but the sincerity and intensity are common threads. As one commentator observed, *“there has always been a parallel between those who claim to have witnessed angels or divine beings, and those who encounter aliens, or in times past, fairies”* ([The Miracle Of Fatima: A Visit By Mary—or Something Stranger? | Tom Rapsas](https://www.patheos.com/blogs/wakeupcall/2021/05/the-miracle-of-fatima-a-visit-by-mary-or-something-stranger/#:~:text=People%20were%20%E2%80%9Cafraid%E2%80%9D%20and%20sensed,them%2C%20sometimes%20good%2C%20sometimes%20not)). In all cases, *“these entities often appear out of nowhere and disappear just as quickly… They defy rational explanation. They leave an indelible impression”* on those who witness them ([The Miracle Of Fatima: A Visit By Mary—or Something Stranger? | Tom Rapsas](https://www.patheos.com/blogs/wakeupcall/2021/05/the-miracle-of-fatima-a-visit-by-mary-or-something-stranger/#:~:text=People%20were%20%E2%80%9Cafraid%E2%80%9D%20and%20sensed,them%2C%20sometimes%20good%2C%20sometimes%20not)). It is this indelible impression that makes the study of such experiences important. They shed light on the **human capacity for belief, perception, and meaning-making**.

Going forward, interdisciplinary study is key. Historians, theologians, psychologists, and physicists each have something to contribute to unraveling these phenomena. Government agencies, too, have begun to acknowledge that understanding UFO sightings isn’t just about physics or aircraft but involves **human perception and belief systems**. By comparing UFO encounters with historical religious experiences, researchers can **separate the constant from the variable** – the core phenomenology from the cultural interpretation. This not only helps in approaching the UFO question with more nuance, but also enriches our understanding of religious experience as a human phenomenon. Are these episodes messages from gods or aliens, or are they mirrorings of our own hopes and fears? Multiple hypotheses exist, from the mundane to the metaphysical. 

In the end, the **patterns and intersections** we’ve explored suggest that UFO encounters and sacred visions occupy a similar space in human experience: they are events at the **fringe of the known**, invoking terror and wonder, and inspiring stories that endure. Whether one leans toward a spiritual explanation, an extraterrestrial hypothesis, or a psychological one, the overlapping narratives cannot be easily dismissed. As Jung intimated and modern scholars echo, our *“search for understanding is deeply intertwined with our innermost spiritual and psychological needs”*, and sometimes we **look to the skies** – expecting to find answers, and finding reflections of ourselves ([Are UFO Sightings And Religious Belief Intimately Connected? ](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2024/6/28/are-ufo-sightings-and-religious-belief-intimately-connected#:~:text=His%20work%20invited%2C%20and%20still,sometimes%20answers%20to%20existential%20questions)). The dialogue between UFOs and religion thus opens a fascinating window into how we construct reality and seek the transcendent, reminding us that perhaps the truth is not just “out there” but also **within us**.
