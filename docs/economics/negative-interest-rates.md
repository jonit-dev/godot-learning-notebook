# Negative Real Interest Rates, “True” Inflation, and the S&P 500 as an Inflation Proxy

## Negative Real Interest Rates in the US and Canada  
**Real interest rate** is the nominal interest rate minus inflation. Both the United States and Canada have recently seen **negative real interest rates**, meaning inflation (however measured) is outpacing interest yields. For example, in 2021–2022 the U.S. Federal Reserve kept short-term rates near 0% while CPI inflation surged above 5–8%, yielding real rates around –5% or lower. In Canada, the Bank of Canada’s policy rate sat at 0.25% even as inflation hit 8% in 2022, so savers experienced roughly –7% real returns on cash ([Canada’s inflation rate and what it means for your investments - MoneySense](https://www.moneysense.ca/spend/inflation-rate-in-canada/#:~:text=you%20can%20still%20find%20GICs,otherwise%20leave%20their%20money%20in)). Such negative real rates erode purchasing power – **savers “lose the real value” of their money while borrowers benefit** ([](https://ca.fierarealestate.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Fiera-Real-Estate-White-Paper-Negative-Real-Interest-Rates-Are-Here-to-Stay_V6.pdf#:~:text=applies%20to%20savers%20who%20deposit,advance%20use%20of%20the%20dollars)). Central bankers acknowledged this: a former BoC Deputy Governor noted in early 2023 that *“we are still in negative real interest rate territory,”* despite rate hikes, because inflation remained high ([John Murray on BNN – We are Still in Negative Real Interest Rate Territory  – C.D. Howe Institute](https://cdhowe.org/publication/john-murray-bnn-we-are-still-negative-real-interest-rate-territory/#:~:text=John%20Murray%2C%20Senior%20Fellow%20at,lived)). 

When we **consider inflation in broader terms** – including rapid money supply expansion and currency debasement – real rates are even more deeply negative. **During the 2020–2021 pandemic response, the U.S. money supply (M2) exploded by ~27% – the largest jump in history** (bigger than WWII or the 1970s) ([Understanding the Money Supply - Wheaton College, IL](https://www.wheaton.edu/academics/academic-centers/wheaton-center-for-faith-politics-and-economics/resource-center/articles/2021/understanding-the-money-supply/#:~:text=Our%20nation%E2%80%99s%20current%20monetary%20policy,2021)). Interest rates, however, were near zero, so in effect the **currency was being devalued far faster than any interest one could earn**. In Canada, a similar story played out: the government and central bank injected over \$500 billion of new liquidity during 2020–21 (financed by BoC bond purchases), which flooded the economy with cash ([Canada’s inflation rate and what it means for your investments - MoneySense](https://www.moneysense.ca/spend/inflation-rate-in-canada/#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20reasons%20inflation,largely%20thanks%20to%20these%20programs)). This helped spur a sharp rise in prices once pandemic lockdowns eased ([Canada’s inflation rate and what it means for your investments - MoneySense](https://www.moneysense.ca/spend/inflation-rate-in-canada/#:~:text=billion%20on%20pandemic,largely%20thanks%20to%20these%20programs)) ([Canada’s inflation rate and what it means for your investments - MoneySense](https://www.moneysense.ca/spend/inflation-rate-in-canada/#:~:text=Advertisement)). **From a libertarian/Austrian viewpoint, this is deliberate “financial repression” – policymakers hold interest rates below the rate of currency debasement to aid debtors (including governments) at the expense of savers** ([](https://ca.fierarealestate.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Fiera-Real-Estate-White-Paper-Negative-Real-Interest-Rates-Are-Here-to-Stay_V6.pdf#:~:text=There%20is%20a%20clear%20correlation,than%20the%20rate%20of%20inflation)). In plain terms, heavily indebted governments *“cannot sustain positive real rates for long”* without risking fiscal stress ([](https://ca.fierarealestate.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Fiera-Real-Estate-White-Paper-Negative-Real-Interest-Rates-Are-Here-to-Stay_V6.pdf#:~:text=There%20is%20a%20clear%20correlation,than%20the%20rate%20of%20inflation)), so they tolerate (or even seek) negative real yields that gradually inflate away debt. Indeed, if one uses an **alternative inflation gauge (~10%+) instead of official CPI, the real yield on safe assets has been hugely negative**. For instance, around 2020 the 10-year US Treasury bond yielded under 1%, but true cost-of-living inflation (per Chapwood Index) was estimated ~10% – implying a real rate near **–9.5%**, one of the most negative in U.S. history ([Inflation — running out of road - Research - Goldmoney](https://www.goldmoney.com/research/inflation-running-out-of-road#:~:text=match%20at%20L177%20anything%20like,annals%20of%20US%20monetary%20history)). In summary, by **adjusting for monetary expansion and currency weakness, both the US and Canada have been experiencing significantly negative real interest rates**, meaning wealth held in cash or low-yield bonds has been steadily losing purchasing power.

## Do Official Inflation Metrics Understate the “Real” Cost of Living?  
Another question is whether **official inflation measures (CPI)** accurately capture the real cost of living, or if they under-report true inflation. Many economists trust the CPI, but **independent analysts and Austrian-school economists have long argued CPI is a *“myth” that understates actual inflation** ([Inflation — running out of road - Research - Goldmoney](https://www.goldmoney.com/research/inflation-running-out-of-road#:~:text=If%20you%20think%20that%20price,been%20doing%20so%20since%202010)). Over the past decade, **official CPI in the U.S. averaged around 1–2%**, yet people felt a higher pinch in expenses. Alternative indices attempt to measure “true” inflation: for example, **John Williams’ ShadowStats** re-calculates inflation using older methodologies (before 1980/1990s adjustments). **ShadowStats consistently finds inflation much higher than official reports**. As Britannica notes, if official CPI is ~3.7%, ShadowStats estimates it would be about **8% using 1990s methods, or ~12% by 1980s standards** ([Comparing Economic Data Sources: Private vs. Government | Britannica Money](https://www.britannica.com/money/private-vs-government-economic-data#:~:text=Some%20private%20analytics%20firms%2C%20such,by%20the%201980s%20formula)). These huge gaps suggest that changes in CPI methodology (like substitution and hedonic adjustments) have *“moved the CPI away from being a measure of the cost of living needed to maintain a constant standard of living”* ([  Alternate Inflation Charts](https://www.shadowstats.com/alternate_data/inflation-charts#:~:text=The%20CPI%20chart%20on%20the,a%20constant%20standard%20of%20living)). In other words, **critics argue the government’s basket understates how much costs actually rise for ordinary people**. 

Two oft-cited private measures are the **Chapwood Index** and **ShadowStats’ alternate CPI**, which have shown alarmingly high inflation rates in the 2010s. *“If you think price inflation runs about 1.6%, you have fallen for the BLS’s CPI myth,”* wrote analyst Alasdair Macleod – pointing out that Chapwood and ShadowStats **found price increases on the order of ~10% per year** since 2010 ([Inflation — running out of road - Research - Goldmoney](https://www.goldmoney.com/research/inflation-running-out-of-road#:~:text=If%20you%20think%20that%20price,been%20doing%20so%20since%202010)). The Chapwood Index compiled the price changes of 500 everyday items in major U.S. cities, finding annual inflation *averaging* **10.1% from 2010–2020** (with some cities as high as 13% and never below ~7%) ([Inflation — running out of road - Research - Goldmoney](https://www.goldmoney.com/research/inflation-running-out-of-road#:~:text=Now%20let%20us%20reconsider%20Jay,economy%20has%20been%20in%20a)). Over the same period the BLS’s CPI-U averaged only 1.7% ([Inflation — running out of road - Research - Goldmoney](https://www.goldmoney.com/research/inflation-running-out-of-road#:~:text=Now%20let%20us%20reconsider%20Jay,economy%20has%20been%20in%20a)). This implies a massive divergence between **official vs. experienced inflation** – a gap corroborated by ShadowStats’ calculations using 1980-era CPI definitions ([Inflation — running out of road - Research - Goldmoney](https://www.goldmoney.com/research/inflation-running-out-of-road#:~:text=match%20at%20L76%20ten%20years,Lehman%20crisis%20and%20last%20February)). **Many everyday Americans feel this discrepancy**: essentials like housing, healthcare, food, and college often rose faster than the CPI basket. Austrian economists note that **asset prices and commodities boomed even as CPI stayed low**, meaning inflation was present—it just appeared in markets rather than consumer goods ([The Many Failures of the CPI | Mises Institute](https://mises.org/mises-daily/many-failures-cpi#:~:text=for%20the%20lack%20of%20anticipated,goods%2C%20real%20estate%2C%20and%20stocks)). They define inflation first and foremost as *“a politically engineered increase in the money supply,”* with price rises as a symptom ([The Many Failures of the CPI | Mises Institute](https://mises.org/mises-daily/many-failures-cpi#:~:text=Austrians%20oppose%20the%20whole%20notion,increase%20in%20the%20money%20supply)). By that definition, we undeniably had high inflation in the 2010s (via QE and easy money) even though **official CPI failed to register it** in consumer prices. In short, **alternative estimates suggest the true cost of living has been rising faster than official CPI in both the US and Canada**, especially for middle-class households. (It’s telling that **deflating GDP by Chapwood’s ~10% inflation rate implies the US economy *shrank* in real terms over the past decade**, rather than grew – a provocative result that highlights how different the story can look under an alternate lens ([Inflation — running out of road - Research - Goldmoney](https://www.goldmoney.com/research/inflation-running-out-of-road#:~:text=M1%20monetary%20inflation%20averaged%2016,is%20illustrated%20in%20Figure%203)) ([Inflation — running out of road - Research - Goldmoney](https://www.goldmoney.com/research/inflation-running-out-of-road#:~:text=gets%20worse%20for%20Powell,is%20illustrated%20in%20Figure%203)).) 

*That said, these non-official indexes are controversial.* Some economists dispute their accuracy, noting potential biases or statistical issues. For example, critiques of ShadowStats have found **methodological errors that overstate its inflation readings** ([Moneyness: Cross-checking ShadowStats](https://jpkoning.blogspot.com/2021/09/cross-checking-shadowstats.html#:~:text=Dolan%20saves%20his%20best%20criticism,fans%20like%20to%20make%20out)), and cross-checks (like comparing past prices of grocery staples to now) often show the official CPI actually tracks reality more closely ([Moneyness: Cross-checking ShadowStats](https://jpkoning.blogspot.com/2021/09/cross-checking-shadowstats.html#:~:text=The%20other%20part%20of%20Dolan%27s,grocery%20prices%20actually%20ended%20up)). The Chapwood Index, while eye-opening, isn’t a rigorously peer-reviewed measure, and it stopped publishing after a few years. Thus, **whether official CPI “understates” inflation is hotly debated** – but what’s clear is that **measuring “real” inflation is complex**, and many believe **the **actual** cost of living is rising faster than the ~~2% CPI target would suggest**. This skepticism is especially common in libertarian and Austrian circles, which emphasize metrics like money-supply growth, **gold prices**, and **broad asset prices** as better barometers of inflationary pressure than the government’s basket of goods.

## Is the S&P 500 a Proxy for Real Inflation?  
With traditional inflation gauges in question, some analysts look to **asset prices** as indicators of inflation. The U.S. stock market, in particular the S&P 500, has climbed dramatically over the past decade. Could the **S&P 500 index be reflecting the true inflation (currency debasement)** that CPI misses? In many ways, the stock market’s performance has been fueled by the same forces driving monetary inflation – **near-zero interest rates, quantitative easing (QE), and rampant liquidity** – leading some to argue that **equities serve as a hedge or proxy for inflation**. Here we examine several facets of the relationship:

- **Historical Performance vs. Inflation:** Over the long run, stocks *tend* to outpace consumer price inflation, but the relationship is complicated. In **periods of extremely high inflation, equities often struggle in real terms**. For instance, during the U.S. “Great Inflation” of the 1970s (when CPI annual inflation often hit 10–15%), stock returns were generally poor after inflation. A study of 8 years with double-digit inflation found U.S. stocks *lost* an average of 7.3% **per year in real terms** during those high-inflation years ([Inflation and the US Bond and Stock Markets | O'Shaughnessy Asset Management](https://www.osam.com/Commentary/inflation-and-the-us-bonds-and-stock-markets#:~:text=Figure%202%20clearly%20illustrates%2C%20severe,at%20each%20period%20more%20closely)). Likewise, in the late 1970s, stock valuations languished as inflation soared. Conversely, in more moderate inflation environments, stocks have delivered positive real returns – companies can pass some costs to consumers, and equities represent claims on real assets. **Overall, the correlation between annual CPI and S&P 500 returns has not been consistent**; equities are not a perfect short-term inflation hedge (they can even decline when inflation spikes). However, **when “real inflation” is defined more broadly (including asset inflation)**, the stock market’s rise in an era of low CPI can be viewed as **“inflation showing up in asset prices”**. As Mark Thornton quipped, while the Fed fretted in the 2010s about CPI being under 2%, *“if you looked at…commodities, oil, gold, real estate, and stocks,” prices were rising in almost every other market* ([The Many Failures of the CPI | Mises Institute](https://mises.org/mises-daily/many-failures-cpi#:~:text=for%20the%20lack%20of%20anticipated,goods%2C%20real%20estate%2C%20and%20stocks)). In that sense, the S&P 500’s steady climb was a *signal* of underlying inflationary pressure – just not the kind of inflation that shows up in grocery prices.

- **Monetary Policy and Asset-Price Inflation:** There is strong evidence that **easy monetary policy (QE and low rates) fueled a massive asset inflation** that drove stocks upward. The Federal Reserve’s balance sheet exploded from under \$1 trillion in 2008 to nearly \$9 trillion by 2022, and this flood of liquidity found its way into financial markets. The result was **soaring asset prices across the board**. As one analysis put it, when the Fed expanded its balance sheet and **“flooded the economy with additional cash,” it kept rates near zero and *propped up equity markets*** ([Fed Balance Sheet vs S&P500](https://www.currentmarketvaluation.com/posts/fed-balance-sheet-vs-sp500.php#:~:text=The%20balance%20sheet%20of%20the,the%20relationship%20between%20interest%20rates)). Investors, armed with cheap credit and fresh liquidity, bid up stocks (and real estate, etc.) because there were few alternatives (the “TINA” effect – *There Is No Alternative* to stocks when bonds pay nothing). Empirically, the timing fits: the S&P 500 roughly **tripled** from its 2009 crisis low to 2019, a period that coincided with unprecedented Fed easing and multiple rounds of QE. Even more telling, **when the Fed launched QE1 in late 2008, stocks and commodity prices both surged**. Between the start of QE (2009) and mid-2011, the S&P 500 rose ~50% and a broad commodities index jumped ~80% ([The Fed's QE Makes Life Difficult - Reason Foundation](https://reason.org/commentary/the-feds-qe-makes-life-difficult/#:~:text=The%20result%20is%20the%20same%3A,have%20all%20more%20than%20doubled)), despite only mild CPI increases. This **asset inflation** reflected the new money chasing investments. More recently, the huge monetary expansion in 2020–2021 (QE and fiscal stimulus) helped the S&P 500 skyrocket to record highs well ahead of any real economic recovery. In short, **central bank policy that drives money-supply growth tends to inflate asset values**, making stock indices partially a barometer of monetary inflation. (Notably, when the Fed later tightened policy in 2022–23 to fight CPI inflation, stocks wobbled, illustrating their dependence on liquidity.)

- **Stock Buybacks and Artificial Asset Pumping:** In addition to central bank liquidity, **corporate actions like share buybacks have made the S&P 500 appear to “inflate” steadily**. Buybacks reduce the number of shares, boosting earnings-per-share and often stock prices, **without reflecting a fundamental improvement in the economy**. In the 2010s, U.S. companies engaged in record share repurchases – effectively *“pumping”* their own stock prices. Between 2008 and 2017, for example, **466 S&P 500 companies spent about \$4 **trillion** on buybacks, equal to 53% of their profits** ([How Stock Buybacks Impact the Economy Op: Ed – Michigan Journal of Economics](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/mje/2024/05/11/how-stock-buybacks-impact-the-economy-op-ed/#:~:text=reinvesting%20profits%20in%20their%20workers%2C,individuals%20with%20holdings%20in%20a)). This financial engineering contributed to the market’s rise: by creating constant demand for shares and shrinking float, buybacks drove prices higher **even if revenue or broader growth was lackluster**. Critics argue this has been a form of **artificial asset inflation** – executives chose to boost stock value (which also ties to their compensation) rather than invest in new production. The result is a stock market that outpaces the *real economy*. Libertarian commentators often point out that ultra-cheap credit (thanks to central banks) encouraged **debt-funded buybacks**, further **inflating stock valuations beyond what organic economic growth would merit**. In essence, *easy money enabled companies to bid up their own shares*, contributing to the S&P’s role as a gauge of liquidity-driven inflation. While this enriches shareholders, it doesn’t necessarily reflect a proportional rise in *real* corporate output or living standards.

- **Currency Debasement and Stock Values:** **A key Austrian perspective** is that a rising nominal stock index can simply indicate a **fall in the currency’s value**, rather than genuine wealth creation. If the dollar (or Canadian dollar) is **“debased”** – i.e. if its purchasing power declines due to more units of currency in circulation – then prices of all assets *denominated in that currency* will rise. **Stocks, being real ownership claims, act as a store of value when the currency weakens**. For example, since the early 2000s the U.S. dollar’s trade-weighted value has fallen substantially (about 39% down from 2002 to 2011) ([The Fed's QE Makes Life Difficult - Reason Foundation](https://reason.org/commentary/the-feds-qe-makes-life-difficult/#:~:text=The%20reality%20is%20that%20the,has%20done%20nothing%20but%20fall)). In that same period, hard assets like gold quintupled in price (gold +500% from 2002–2011) ([The Fed's QE Makes Life Difficult - Reason Foundation](https://reason.org/commentary/the-feds-qe-makes-life-difficult/#:~:text=The%20reality%20is%20that%20the,has%20done%20nothing%20but%20fall)). The S&P 500’s gains can be seen in part as **compensation for a weaker dollar** – each dollar is worth less, so you need more of them to buy the same stake in a company. In fact, if you measure the S&P 500 in **hard money terms (like gold)**, its performance looks far more muted. This underscores that **stocks serve as an inflation hedge in the sense that they represent real businesses that adjust to price levels**. During extreme currency debasement or hyperinflation (e.g. Weimar Germany or Zimbabwe scenarios), stock markets tend to skyrocket in nominal terms, preserving some real value for investors while cash becomes worthless. Thus, many libertarians argue the S&P 500’s relentless climb is *telling us the dollar is losing value*. **Corporate revenues and stock prices are higher largely because there are more dollars (or loonies) in the system, not necessarily because of commensurate real growth**. However, it’s not a 1:1 proxy – companies still must have earnings and investors can become fearful (as in 2022 when stocks fell even as inflation was high). But over time, **a debased currency almost inevitably leads to higher stock prices in nominal terms**, which can make the stock index a rough mirror of cumulative inflation. 

In summary, **the S&P 500 can indeed reflect “real” inflationary forces**, especially those stemming from **monetary inflation and currency debasement** that aren’t fully captured by CPI. The index’s strong rise in the 2010s while official inflation stayed low suggests that a lot of the “excess money” injected by the Fed found its way into asset prices (stocks, real estate, etc.) rather than consumer goods – a phenomenon often dubbed **“asset price inflation.”** By tracking the S&P 500’s growth relative to fundamentals, one can gauge the impact of **quantitative easing and easy credit** on inflation. That said, **stocks are influenced by many factors**: investor sentiment, innovation, global events, and profits. They are **not a perfect inflation meter** – e.g. in stagflation of the 1970s, stocks lagged badly. But from an Austrian perspective, **the stock market has been a leading indicator of inflationary policy**: equities rose in response to money-supply growth long before CPI caught up. This makes the S&P 500 *function as a proxy for the hidden inflation* that accrues in a fiat-money system. As one libertarian author put it, *“the purchasing power of the dollar is falling as the Fed directs money artificially toward stocks, bonds, and commodities”* ([The Fed's QE Makes Life Difficult - Reason Foundation](https://reason.org/commentary/the-feds-qe-makes-life-difficult/#:~:text=The%20reality%20is%20that%20the,has%20done%20nothing%20but%20fall)). In effect, rising asset prices **are** inflation – just manifest in financial markets. Investors thus use the stock market, alongside gold, real estate, and other assets, to **protect against currency debasement** when real interest rates are deeply negative.

## Conclusion  
**Both the United States and Canada have been navigating an environment of negative real interest rates and potential understatement of inflation.** When accounting for **unprecedented money supply growth and currency creation**, the true **inflation-adjusted return on savings** has been deeply negative, penalizing savers. Official inflation metrics like CPI, while useful, may not fully capture the **actual cost-of-living increases** experienced by the public – alternative estimates (ShadowStats, Chapwood) paint a much higher inflation picture (often in the upper single or double digits) ([Inflation — running out of road - Research - Goldmoney](https://www.goldmoney.com/research/inflation-running-out-of-road#:~:text=If%20you%20think%20that%20price,been%20doing%20so%20since%202010)) ([Comparing Economic Data Sources: Private vs. Government | Britannica Money](https://www.britannica.com/money/private-vs-government-economic-data#:~:text=Some%20private%20analytics%20firms%2C%20such,by%20the%201980s%20formula)). This debate aligns with the **Austrian and libertarian viewpoint** that **inflation is fundamentally about money supply**, and that **government has incentives to downplay inflation** to reduce real debt burdens and avoid unrest ([](https://ca.fierarealestate.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Fiera-Real-Estate-White-Paper-Negative-Real-Interest-Rates-Are-Here-to-Stay_V6.pdf#:~:text=There%20is%20a%20clear%20correlation,than%20the%20rate%20of%20inflation)). In that context, the **booming stock market can be seen as a reflection of inflationary policy**: the S&P 500’s rise has coincided with massive **quantitative easing, low interest loans, and even corporate financial engineering**, all of which **inflate asset values**. While the S&P 500 is not a perfect measure of consumer inflation, it has effectively hedged against the dollar’s debasement – acting as a sort of **“canary in the coal mine”** for the inflation created by loose monetary policy. 

Going forward, it’s crucial for analysts and investors to consider **multiple gauges of inflation**. **Official CPI** tells us about **consumer goods and services**, but **money supply trends, commodity prices, housing costs, and asset valuations** provide a more complete picture of **“real” inflation and currency value.** As history shows, sustained negative real interest rates and **suppressed official inflation statistics** are often followed by a catch-up of reality – either via a surge in consumer prices or financial market corrections. By **examining the data holistically** – from CPI and ShadowStats to M2 growth and the S&P 500 – we get a clearer view of how much inflation is in the system. And that view suggests that in both the U.S. and Canada, **expansionary monetary policy has indeed created an inflationary undercurrent**: one that erodes fiat currency purchasing power (even if stealthily), **requiring investors to seek shelter in real assets and equities to preserve wealth** ([The Fed's QE Makes Life Difficult - Reason Foundation](https://reason.org/commentary/the-feds-qe-makes-life-difficult/#:~:text=The%20reality%20is%20that%20the,has%20done%20nothing%20but%20fall)). In essence, **inflation is either in the checkout aisle or in the stock ticker – or both – and prudent analysis must account for both official and unofficial measures to grasp the true economic reality.** ([The Many Failures of the CPI | Mises Institute](https://mises.org/mises-daily/many-failures-cpi#:~:text=Austrians%20oppose%20the%20whole%20notion,increase%20in%20the%20money%20supply)) ([The Many Failures of the CPI | Mises Institute](https://mises.org/mises-daily/many-failures-cpi#:~:text=for%20the%20lack%20of%20anticipated,goods%2C%20real%20estate%2C%20and%20stocks))
