# “Buy, Borrow, Die” in Canada: Feasibility for an Average Millionaire

**Introduction:** “Buy, Borrow, Die” is a wealth strategy where one buys assets, *borrows* against those assets instead of selling (to avoid triggering taxes), and holds them until they *die*. It’s often discussed in the context of ultra-wealthy U.S. investors who avoid capital gains tax by never selling and then passing on assets with a stepped-up tax basis. In a Canadian context, the concept works a bit differently – there’s no step-up in cost basis at death, so taxes are eventually due ([Named in the Will? What to Know About Canadian Inheritance Tax Laws | 2023 TurboTax® Canada Tips](https://turbotax.intuit.ca/tips/do-you-pay-taxes-on-money-you-inherited-467#:~:text=In%20Canada%2C%20there%20is%20no,Why%3F#:~:text=When%20a%20loved%20one%20passes%2C,inheritance%20is%20immune%20from%20taxation)). This answer explores how an individual with around $1 million net worth (an “average millionaire”) in Canada could implement “Buy, Borrow, Die,” focusing on asset-backed loans like Securities-Based Lending (SBL) and other practical borrowing methods. Key considerations such as interest rates, lenders, alternative loan types, tax implications, risks, and how the strategy differs for the ultra-wealthy versus a typical millionaire are discussed.

## What is “Buy, Borrow, Die” (BBD)?

- **Buy:** Build up assets (e.g. stocks, real estate) and allow them to appreciate. Wealth is accumulated in assets rather than as cash income.  
- **Borrow:** Instead of selling those assets to fund your lifestyle (which would trigger capital gains taxes on any appreciation), borrow against them. Loans provide liquidity for living expenses or new investments, and loan proceeds aren’t taxed as income. This lets you *monetize* your asset’s value without selling it.  
- **Die:** Upon death, in the U.S. the assets would get a stepped-up cost basis (so capital gains tax is erased for the heirs). In Canada, there’s **no step-up** – when you die, the Canada Revenue Agency treats it as if you sold everything at market value, and taxes the capital gains on your final tax return ([Buy, Borrow, Die – Explained | Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41408772#:~:text=If%20this%20in%20Canada%2C%20this,was%20a%20decent%20strategy)) ([Named in the Will? What to Know About Canadian Inheritance Tax Laws | 2023 TurboTax® Canada Tips](https://turbotax.intuit.ca/tips/do-you-pay-taxes-on-money-you-inherited-467#:~:text=In%20Canada%2C%20there%20is%20no,Why%3F#:~:text=When%20a%20loved%20one%20passes%2C,inheritance%20is%20immune%20from%20taxation)). There’s no separate inheritance tax, because the tax on unrealized gains is handled by the estate at death ([Named in the Will? What to Know About Canadian Inheritance Tax Laws | 2023 TurboTax® Canada Tips](https://turbotax.intuit.ca/tips/do-you-pay-taxes-on-money-you-inherited-467#:~:text=In%20Canada%2C%20there%20is%20no,Why%3F#:~:text=When%20a%20loved%20one%20passes%2C,inheritance%20is%20immune%20from%20taxation)). If you have a spouse, the assets can transfer to them tax-deferred, but when the surviving spouse dies or assets are eventually sold, the accumulated gains are taxed.  

**Goal of the strategy:** Minimize taxes during your lifetime by not selling assets (thus deferring capital gains taxes indefinitely) and funding your needs with loans. For wealthy families, this can significantly reduce taxes paid in life, and in some cases (especially in the U.S.) much of the tax can be avoided entirely. In Canada, it’s more about deferral and potentially some tax arbitrage (timing and rate of taxation), since ultimately the tax man catches up at death or sale. The appeal is that you keep your investments growing *pre-tax* for as long as possible, and loans (if managed well) can be cheaper than the tax you’d pay by selling assets.

## Securities-Based Lending (SBL) in Canada

**How SBL Works:** Securities-Based Lending means borrowing against your investment portfolio. You pledge your stocks, bonds, or other securities as collateral and receive a loan or line of credit secured by those assets ([Securities-based lending - RBC Clearing & Custody](https://www.rbcclearingandcustody.com/en-us/products-and-services/securities-based-lending/#:~:text=A%20fast%20and%20flexible%20credit,against%20their%20taxable%20investment%20portfolio)). This is essentially a margin loan or a specialized line of credit offered by brokers and banks. Typically: 

- You can borrow a percentage of your portfolio’s value (often 50-70% of eligible securities).  
- The lender charges interest, usually a variable rate. Payments can be **interest-only**, and you can repay principal whenever you like (or not until you’re forced) ([Securities-based lending - RBC Clearing & Custody](https://www.rbcclearingandcustody.com/en-us/products-and-services/securities-based-lending/#:~:text=Once%20approved%2C%20clients%20can%20access,be%20fixed%20on%20outstanding%20balances)).  
- If your portfolio value declines, you’re required to top up collateral or partially repay – this is the **margin call** risk. If you can’t meet the maintenance requirements, the lender can sell your securities to reduce the loan, potentially without notice ([Securities-based lending - RBC Clearing & Custody](https://www.rbcclearingandcustody.com/en-us/products-and-services/securities-based-lending/#:~:text=Similar%20to%20a%20margin%20loan%2C,be%20sold%20without%20prior%20notice)). In other words, much like a margin account, an SBL is a demand loan: the lender can demand more collateral or repayment if the loan-to-value gets too high.

**Key lenders and options in Canada:** 

- **Interactive Brokers (IB)** – A popular choice for individual investors. IB offers some of the lowest margin rates globally. For example, IB’s Canadian dollar margin loan rates were around ~4.4% for smaller balances (under CAD 130k) and down to ~3.7% for very large balances (CAD 1.3M+), as of late 2024 ([Margin Rates and Financing | Interactive Brokers Canada Inc.](https://www.interactivebrokers.ca/en/trading/margin-rates.php#:~:text=CAD%200%20%E2%89%A4%20130%2C000%204.477,%5E%7B1)). IB’s account is a margin account (you can borrow against your portfolio for any purpose). It’s accessible to retail investors; with a $1M portfolio, you can readily use IB’s margin lending and benefit from those low rates.  
- **Major Banks (Brokerage or Private Banking)** – Big banks in Canada (RBC, BMO, TD, etc.) offer securities-backed loans, typically to wealth management clients. For instance, RBC’s **Credit Access Line** allows clients to borrow against their taxable investment portfolio with a minimum line of $75k ([Securities-based lending - RBC Clearing & Custody](https://www.rbcclearingandcustody.com/en-us/products-and-services/securities-based-lending/#:~:text=Your%20clients%20can%20open%20a,draw%20as%20little%20as%20%241%2C000)). Rates at banks are usually tied to their prime rate or a spread above it. In a standard brokerage margin account with a bank, rates can be relatively high – e.g. RBC Direct Investing was charging about **7.5%** on CAD margin loans for regular clients (and ~6.75% for their high-volume “Royal Circle” clients) in late 2024 ([Cash and Margin Interest Rates - RBC Direct Investing](https://www.rbcdirectinvesting.com/pricing/cash-margin-rates.html#:~:text=Investment%20Account%20%28Non,25)). Private banking clients with large assets might negotiate better rates, but an “average” millionaire might get something around prime or prime minus a bit on an investment line of credit. Banks often position SBL as a convenient way for wealthy clients to access liquidity without disrupting investments. The process may involve setting up a separate line of credit facility secured by your investment account (in some cases more paperwork than a simple margin account, but it can offer flexibility like fixed interest options).  
- **Independent/Private Lenders** – There are specialized lenders or “shadow banks” that might issue loans against securities (for example, some fintech companies or private finance firms). These are less common for average investors and usually come into play for either ultra-high-net-worth situations or when the securities are unusual (like a large block of a single stock, or private company shares). They often charge higher interest (to compensate for higher risk or bespoke arrangements). For most people, a combination of a brokerage margin or a bank’s secured line of credit will cover SBL needs.

**Interest Rates and Costs:** SBL rates vary widely. As noted, IB offers very low rates (often the cheapest option for individuals) ([Anybody have any experience with an SBLOC (Securities-Backed Line of Credit)? : r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/poz6g9/anybody_have_any_experience_with_an_sbloc/#:~:text=Interactive%20Brokers%20offers%20the%20best,rates)). Banks charge higher spreads – for example, if the bank’s prime rate is ~7%, an investment LOC might be ~7% as well or a bit more/less. You should compare: a $1M client might find IB at ~4% vs a bank at ~7%, which is a big difference in cost. Also, note that SBL interest rates can be **tiered** by loan size; larger loans get better rates ([Anybody have any experience with an SBLOC (Securities-Backed Line of Credit)? : r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/poz6g9/anybody_have_any_experience_with_an_sbloc/#:~:text=You%20pretty%20much%20have%20it,is%20usually%20pretty%20standard)) ([Anybody have any experience with an SBLOC (Securities-Backed Line of Credit)? : r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/poz6g9/anybody_have_any_experience_with_an_sbloc/#:~:text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.schwab.com%2Fpledged)). In practice, an average millionaire may not qualify for the *very* best rates unless their loan is quite large or they have significant assets with the lender. But even at moderate levels, SBL can be competitive with other borrowing options.

**Example:** If you have a $1M stock portfolio at a broker, you might be able to borrow roughly $300k–$500k against it (depending on the marginable securities and risk limits). If using IB, $300k might cost ~1.08%–1.58% (when rates were low) ([Anybody have any experience with an SBLOC (Securities-Backed Line of Credit)? : r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/poz6g9/anybody_have_any_experience_with_an_sbloc/#:~:text=Interactive%20Brokers%20offers%20the%20best,rates)) or a few percent in a higher rate environment; at a bank, $300k might cost ~prime (~6-7%). The loan can be drawn as needed and you only pay interest on what you use. You don’t have to sell your stocks, so you avoid realizing any capital gains. As long as your stocks don’t plummet (triggering a margin call) and you can cover the interest, you can keep this loan indefinitely.

## Alternative Asset-Backed Borrowing Strategies

Borrowing against a stock portfolio is one way to implement “Borrow” in BBD. But an average millionaire may have wealth spread across different assets. Here are other practical borrowing methods to access cash without selling assets:

- **Home Equity Loans & HELOCs (Home Equity Lines of Credit):** If you own real estate, this is a common way to borrow. In Canada, you can typically access up to 80% of your home’s value (combined mortgage + HELOC). A HELOC is a revolving credit line secured by your home equity. Interest rates are usually variable and tied to prime. For example, with prime around 7%, a HELOC might be offered at prime or prime + 0%–1%, meaning roughly **6–8%** interest in the current environment. Some lenders offer interest-only payments on HELOCs, so you can borrow and just pay the interest monthly (no requirement to pay down principal unless you choose, aside from the loan coming due if the term ends or if the bank demands repayment). Using a HELOC, a person with a $500k house (fully paid off) could borrow up to ~$400k. This is analogous to what the ultra-rich do with their mansions – borrow against them rather than selling. The **pros:** No immediate tax concerns (primary residence sale is tax-free, but this way you still own the house *and* get cash), and no margin call due to market volatility (houses aren’t marked-to-market daily like stocks). **Cons:** You’re putting your home on the line – if you fail to pay interest, the bank can foreclose. And if housing values drop a lot, it doesn’t trigger a margin call, but it may leave you underwater or unable to refinance. Also, HELOC interest is generally not tax-deductible unless used for investment purposes (more on that later). 
- **Traditional Margin Accounts (Brokerage Margin):** Even without a fancy SBL facility, any taxable investment account can typically be a margin account. For example, Questrade or TD Direct Investing allow you to borrow on margin. The rates tend to be higher than IB – often a few percent above prime (Questrade’s rates in 2024 were considered high, roughly 7-9% depending on currency ([Are margin interest rates low at Questrade? - BrokerChooser](https://brokerchooser.com/broker-reviews/questrade-review/questrade-margin-rate#:~:text=Are%20margin%20interest%20rates%20low,the%20best%20margin%20trading%20platforms))). Margin accounts let you buy more securities or withdraw cash against your portfolio. The mechanism and risks are the same as described under SBL. The advantage is convenience if you already use that broker. For a $1M portfolio, you could likely get a significant margin loan, but at ~7% interest it’s a relatively costly way to avoid selling stocks. **Interactive Brokers** stands out as an exception with much lower rates, which is why many savvy investors use IB for this purpose ([Anybody have any experience with an SBLOC (Securities-Backed Line of Credit)? : r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/poz6g9/anybody_have_any_experience_with_an_sbloc/#:~:text=Interactive%20Brokers%20offers%20the%20best,rates)).
- **Leveraging Investment Real Estate:** If part of your $1M net worth is in a rental property or a second property, you can refinance that property to pull out cash rather than selling it. Real estate financing often has lower rates than unsecured loans. For instance, an investment property mortgage might be in the 4-6% range if rates decline, or around 6-7% if rates are higher. And interest on money borrowed to invest in a rental property or other investments can be tax-deductible (since it’s for investment/income generation). This strategy mirrors “buy, borrow, die” by *not* selling the property (thus deferring capital gains and recapture taxes) and instead extracting equity via a loan. When you die, your estate might sell the property to pay off the mortgage and tax, or pass it on with the debt attached. One thing to consider: unlike stocks, real estate isn’t subject to forced margin calls, but you do have to make mortgage payments which include principal – unless you use an interest-only loan (not common in Canada for residential, though some investors use short-term interest-only HELOCs on rentals).
- **Personal Lines of Credit (Unsecured):** An unsecured line of credit doesn’t use assets as collateral. Banks might extend, say, $50k–$100k to a high-income or high-credit individual without specific security. However, interest rates are usually higher (often prime + a bigger spread, e.g., 8-10% or more) because the bank has no collateral. Also, the credit limits are lower. For an average millionaire, an unsecured LOC could be a supplementary source of funds to avoid dipping into investments for smaller needs, but it’s not sufficient for a full “borrow against assets” lifestyle, and the interest isn’t tax-deductible if used for personal expenses. This is a convenience tool rather than a core BBD strategy.
- **Structured Loans and Derivative-Based Strategies:** Ultra-wealthy investors sometimes use sophisticated arrangements like prepaid variable forward contracts or total return swaps to monetize large stock positions without an outright sale. For example, an executive with $50M in a single stock might do a deal with a bank to get a loan or upfront cash in exchange for delivering the shares or equivalent value later. These strategies are bespoke and require legal and financial engineering – not practical for someone with $1M (the scale and cost wouldn’t make sense). However, a scaled-down version could be simply pledging a concentrated stock to a bank for a loan. If an average millionaire has, say, $500k of stock in one company (perhaps from an employee stock program), a bank might offer a loan against those shares, but likely at a conservative LTV and possibly a higher rate due to the single-stock risk. This is more niche and case-by-case.
- **Life Insurance Leverage:** Some investors use permanent life insurance (whole life or universal life policies) as part of their “borrow” strategy. They pay into a policy, which builds a cash value, and then borrow against that cash value or use the policy as collateral for a bank loan. For the wealthy, there’s a known tactic called **Immediate Financing Arrangement (IFA)** – essentially, they borrow back the money used to pay insurance premiums, maintaining liquidity. As RBC describes, a private banking client can borrow to pay large life insurance premiums, pledging the policy and other assets, and only pay interest on the loan; when they pass away, the loan is repaid from the insurance death benefit, and the remainder goes to their heirs ([How high-net-worth Canadians are turning credit into wealth - RBC Wealth Management](https://www.rbcwealthmanagement.com/en-ca/insights/how-high-net-worth-canadians-are-turning-credit-into-wealth#:~:text=involves%20using%20credit%20facilities%20for,planning%20%20and%20%2034)). This lets them get big insurance coverage (for estate planning) without tying up capital. For an average millionaire, this strategy could be considered if they have a need for permanent life insurance – you could take a loan against your policy’s cash value in retirement instead of withdrawing investments. The interest rates on policy loans or collateral loans are usually moderate (maybe comparable to prime). The appeal is that policy loans don’t trigger tax (with some caveats) and the death benefit can pay off the loan. However, this is a complex strategy that really serves as an estate planning tool more than a way to generate living income, unless you have a sizable policy.

In summary, an average millionaire in Canada can tap **multiple borrowing channels**: a margin/SBL against investments, home equity loans, or other asset-based loans. Each has its own interest rates and risks, and part of the “Buy, Borrow, Die” implementation could be choosing the cheapest or most convenient source at any given time. For example, one might use a HELOC to fund living expenses during a market downturn (avoiding selling stocks at a low), then later, when the market has recovered, either pay down the HELOC or switch to a margin loan if that becomes cheaper.

## Loan Rates and Terms: Stocks vs. Real Estate vs. Other Assets

Different asset-backed loans come with different terms. Here’s a comparison of key factors:

- **Loans Against Stocks (SBL/Margin):**  
  - **Typical Loan-to-Value (LTV):** ~50-70% of a diversified stock portfolio’s market value. Blue-chip stocks and government bonds might get the higher end; riskier or volatile stocks get less. Some instruments aren’t marginable at all (e.g., small penny stocks or certain funds).  
  - **Interest Rates:** Widely variable. Low-cost providers like IB charge near-money-market rates (e.g., ~4% in CAD as noted) ([Margin Rates and Financing | Interactive Brokers Canada Inc.](https://www.interactivebrokers.ca/en/trading/margin-rates.php#:~:text=CAD%200%20%E2%89%A4%20130%2C000%204.477,%5E%7B1)). Traditional brokers/banks might charge on the order of prime (~7%) or more ([Cash and Margin Interest Rates - RBC Direct Investing](https://www.rbcdirectinvesting.com/pricing/cash-margin-rates.html#:~:text=Investment%20Account%20%28Non,25)). There can be tiered rates – the first chunk of loan might be at one rate and larger amounts at lower rates ([Anybody have any experience with an SBLOC (Securities-Backed Line of Credit)? : r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/poz6g9/anybody_have_any_experience_with_an_sbloc/#:~:text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.schwab.com%2Fpledged)) ([Anybody have any experience with an SBLOC (Securities-Backed Line of Credit)? : r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/poz6g9/anybody_have_any_experience_with_an_sbloc/#:~:text=Interactive%20Brokers%20offers%20the%20best,rates)). It pays to shop around or negotiate if possible.  
  - **Payment Terms:** Usually interest-only with no set maturity (a **demand loan** or line of credit). As long as you meet margin requirements, you can keep the loan indefinitely. You can pay down and re-borrow at will (if it’s a credit line setup) or just maintain a margin balance. There’s no amortization schedule because the expectation is you might repay by selling securities or from other resources whenever you choose (or at lender’s demand).  
  - **Calls/Force-Selling:** If the portfolio value falls and your equity percentage drops below the required minimum (maintenance margin), the lender will **margin call** you – you must add cash or securities or they will liquidate some of your holdings to reduce the loan. This can happen quickly in a market crash. It’s one of the biggest risks: you could be forced to realize losses (and ironically, that can create a taxable event – possibly a capital loss you might not fully use, or if you still had gains, a taxable gain at a bad time).  
  - **Key Benefit:** Flexibility and no fixed schedule – you only pay interest, and you control when to reduce the loan (absent margin calls). Also, setup is relatively quick (for example, upgrading to a margin account or getting an investment LOC can be faster than a mortgage process).

- **Loans Against Real Estate (Home or Investment Property):**  
  - **Typical Loan-to-Value:** Up to 80% of the property’s value in Canada. If it’s via a HELOC alone, banks often cap the HELOC portion at 65% LTV (you could do 65% HELOC + 15% as a conventional mortgage for 80% total). Investment properties might be limited to a bit lower LTV by some lenders (say 70-75%), depending on rental income and other factors.  
  - **Interest Rates:** Often tied to the bank’s prime rate. As of end-2024, prime is in the ~7% range, so HELOCs are ~7% (some banks offer a little below or above prime). Mortgages can be fixed or variable; a 5-year fixed might be around 5-6% if rates settle, which is lower than typical margin rates at brokers but higher than IB’s ultra-low rate. Essentially, real estate-secured debt tends to be mid-single-digit interest in current conditions – historically, it can be very low (in 2020-2021, HELOCs were ~3% when prime was low) or higher if inflation persists.  
  - **Payment Terms:** A HELOC is flexible (interest-only payments allowed, principal can be repaid anytime). A mortgage has set monthly payments including principal and interest over, say, 25 years. With a HELOC, technically the loan can stay outstanding until you sell the house or the bank reviews the arrangement (many HELOCs are callable or have to be renewed periodically). With a mortgage, you’re expected to pay it down on schedule, though interest-only mortgages exist in some cases (or you could continually refinance to avoid paying principal).  
  - **No Market Margin Calls:** The bank won’t demand repayment just because your house price fluctuates. This is a big plus vs. stock loans. However, if you miss payments or if the term ends and you can’t qualify to renew, then there’s a problem. Also, if the housing market drops and you wanted to refinance for more, you’d be capped by the lower appraisal. But generally, real estate loans are more “set and forget” in the short term compared to margin loans.  
  - **Costs/Fees:** Setting up a HELOC or mortgage might involve an appraisal, legal fees, or setup fees, whereas a margin loan usually has no setup cost. So for occasional or emergency use, margin might be cheaper to set up; for large, long-term needs, a mortgage’s lower rate might offset any setup costs.

- **Loans on Other Asset Classes:**  
  - **Bonds or Fixed Income:** Margin loans against government bonds or high-quality bonds often allow relatively high LTV (they’re stable), and interest rates for borrowing against them might be slightly lower (some brokers give better rates for borrowing against fixed income vs equities, reflecting lower risk – or they might allow more leverage). However, if you already own bonds, selling them might not incur much tax (since bonds don’t often appreciate dramatically in price), so using them as collateral for BBD is less common except as part of an overall portfolio LOC.  
  - **Private Company Shares:** If you own a business (say part of that $1M net worth is equity in a private corporation), borrowing against it is possible but can be complex. Banks may offer a **business loan** or personal loan secured by your shares, but they will heavily assess the company’s financials. Interest rates could be higher (because a private business is illiquid and riskier as collateral), and often these loans have fixed amortizations. This is more relevant for business owners trying to get liquidity without selling the business. For example, you might do an “estate freeze” (restructure the company shares) and have a bank lend to you personally with those shares as collateral. That’s advanced planning territory, usually requiring professional advice. For the average millionaire with a small business, a simpler route is often to have the company pay dividends or sell a portion rather than take a personal loan against it, unless deferral is crucial.  
  - **Other hard assets (gold, art, etc.):** There are niche lenders (and pawn-type arrangements) that will lend against gold, jewelry, art, or other collectibles. Interest rates are generally high and LTV low – for example, a lender might give you 50% of the value of gold at 8-10% interest. These aren’t mainstream for a reason; they’re last-resort or for those who specifically have wealth in those forms and want to leverage it. Some wealthy individuals do borrow against art collections (e.g., through auction houses or private banks), but at $1M net worth, one usually doesn’t have a multimillion-dollar art piece to use as collateral.
  - **Unsecured (no collateral):** Already covered briefly, but it’s worth noting again: if you cannot or prefer not to tie specific assets, unsecured borrowing for large amounts is generally not feasible at good rates for an average person. Maybe you could get a bank to give a $100k unsecured line if you have an excellent credit history, but the interest might be 8% or more. Typically, asset-backed loans will be the primary tool in BBD for better rates and higher limits.

**Comparing Effective Rates:** It’s wise to compare the *after-tax* cost of interest as well, which ties into the next section on tax. For instance, a 5% margin loan used to invest in stocks might have its interest be tax-deductible (if structured properly), so the effective cost to you after tax could be lower (if you’re in a high tax bracket, 5% interest with full deductibility might only cost ~3% net). A 5% HELOC used for personal consumption is not deductible, so 5% is 5%. This can tilt the decision on which asset to borrow against.

In short, **stocks vs real estate**: stock-based loans can be cheaper (with the right broker) and very flexible, but come with volatility risk; real estate loans are steadier but you’re looking at moderately higher interest and a more rigid setup. Many individuals use a combination: e.g., maintain a HELOC for large needs or as a backstop, and use margin loans for opportunistic borrowing or short-term cash flow, always weighing which interest rate is lower at the time.

## Tax Implications and Advantages for Canadian Investors

One of the main drivers of “Buy, Borrow, Die” is tax minimization. Here’s how taxes factor in for a Canadian using this strategy:

- **Loan Proceeds Are Not Taxable:** Money you borrow does **not** count as income. If you take a $100k margin loan or HELOC draw, you don’t report $100k of income, and no tax is due on that money. This is the core benefit – you’re funding your lifestyle with untaxed money (albeit money that you have to pay back). By contrast, if you sold $100k of stocks that had $50k in gains, you’d have to include $25k (50% of $50k) in your taxable income and pay tax on that (which could be, say, ~$12k if you’re in a top bracket). The loan sidesteps that immediate tax. 

- **Capital Gains Deferral:** By not selling appreciated assets, you **defer** capital gains taxes indefinitely. Canada doesn’t forgive the tax, but deferral itself is valuable. It means you have more money compounding over time. For example, if you bought stocks for $200k that are now worth $1M, selling would trigger tax on the $800k gain (which at 50% inclusion might add ~$400k to income). Instead, if you borrow against them, you keep the full $1M invested. If that $1M grows to $2M over X years, you’ll eventually face the tax, but only on the larger gain and later. The time value of money means paying tax later is better than paying now (assuming the asset grows and that the effective tax rate isn’t dramatically higher later). Essentially, you’re delaying the tax drag on your investment returns. 

- **Tax at Death (Estate Taxes):** In Canada, when you die, all your capital property (stocks, real estate, etc.) is deemed sold at fair market value (unless transferred to a spouse). This triggers capital gains tax on all the appreciation in one go on your final tax return ([Named in the Will?

There’s no separate “estate tax” or inheritance tax – it’s this deemed realization that taxes the estate’s assets ([Named in the Will? What to Know About Canadian Inheritance Tax Laws | 2023 TurboTax® Canada Tips](https://turbotax.intuit.ca/tips/do-you-pay-taxes-on-money-you-inherited-467#:~:text=In%20Canada%2C%20there%20is%20no,Why%3F#:~:text=When%20a%20loved%20one%20passes%2C,inheritance%20is%20immune%20from%20taxation)). So, if you successfully avoid selling until death, you’ve deferred tax throughout life, but your estate will have to pay it. The **advantage** here is that you got potentially decades of extra compounding. The **disadvantage** is that, unlike in the U.S., you cannot completely step-up the basis and wash away the tax; it will come due (the only way to avoid it is to donate assets to charity at death, use the principal residence exemption for your home, or other such provisions – but that’s beyond BBD’s basic idea). One small silver lining: if you have a spouse, you can defer the deemed disposition by leaving assets to them (spousal rollover). That pushes the tax to when the spouse sells or dies. For an “average millionaire,” if married, the strategy can extend over two lifetimes, effectively.

- **Interest Deductibility (Tax Deduction on Loan Interest):** This is crucial in Canada. The **Income Tax Act** allows interest on borrowed money to be deducted **if and only if the borrowed funds are used for the purpose of earning income** from a business or property (ITA 20(1)(c)). What does that mean? If you take a loan and invest that money in stocks, bonds, rental property, etc., and there’s a reasonable expectation of income (interest, dividends, rent), the interest is tax-deductible against your income ([](https://ca.rbcwealthmanagement.com/documents/1874925/1874941/Borrowing+to+Invest+-+When+is+Interest+Tax+Deductible.pdf/a299fc9b-245d-4ff5-bb3b-04b970fa4a24#:~:text=does%20not%20need%20to%20exceed,from%20the%20investment%20in%20order)). If you borrow to buy a car or go on vacation (personal use), the interest is not deductible. So, how does this apply to BBD? If you simply take a margin loan to pay your living expenses, that interest isn’t deductible (because the loan wasn’t used to earn income; it was used for personal spending). However, many people employ a strategy to make it deductible: they swap the use of funds. For example: 
  - You need $50k a year to live. Instead of borrowing $50k and spending it, you could sell $50k of investments to get cash for living expenses (which triggers some tax on gains, unfortunately), *and simultaneously borrow $50k on margin to buy new investments*. After these two moves, your portfolio value is the same as before (you sold $50k and bought $50k of something else with the loan). The $50k loan is now clearly used to purchase investments, so the interest on that loan is deductible against your income ([](https://ca.rbcwealthmanagement.com/documents/1874925/1874941/Borrowing+to+Invest+-+When+is+Interest+Tax+Deductible.pdf/a299fc9b-245d-4ff5-bb3b-04b970fa4a24#:~:text=does%20not%20need%20to%20exceed,from%20the%20investment%20in%20order)) ([](https://ca.rbcwealthmanagement.com/documents/1874925/1874941/Borrowing+to+Invest+-+When+is+Interest+Tax+Deductible.pdf/a299fc9b-245d-4ff5-bb3b-04b970fa4a24#:~:text=Common%20shares%20If%20you%20borrow,purpose%20even%20on%20an%20ordinary)). Meanwhile, the $50k you sold is what you’re living on. In effect, you’ve funded your lifestyle with borrowed money, but structured it in a way that the loan is tied to investing. This is akin to the **Smith Maneuver** (where one converts a mortgage into a tax-deductible investment loan) but applied to a portfolio drawdown. The downside is you did trigger some capital gains by selling $50k – so it’s not a complete deferral. But you can manage which assets to sell (maybe choose those with high cost base to minimize gains, or use tax losses if you have them to offset, etc.). This way, you get a tax deduction for the interest, which can partially offset the capital gains tax or other income. 
  - If instead you borrow $50k and directly spend it, you have no deduction. You deferred the capital gains tax entirely, but you get no tax break on the interest cost. Depending on your situation, one or the other could be better. High-income individuals often prefer to keep deductions.  
  - **Important:** If you use this strategy, make sure the investments you buy with borrowed money have the potential to generate income (not just growth). CRA has challenged interest deductibility in cases where people invest in things that produce no income at all (because interest is only deductible if the purpose is to earn income). For example, buying a stock that *never* pays dividends purely for capital gain might be an issue – but most common stocks do pay some dividends or at least have the potential to ([](https://ca.rbcwealthmanagement.com/documents/1874925/1874941/Borrowing+to+Invest+-+When+is+Interest+Tax+Deductible.pdf/a299fc9b-245d-4ff5-bb3b-04b970fa4a24#:~:text=Common%20shares%20If%20you%20borrow,purpose%20even%20on%20an%20ordinary)). The CRA and courts have generally accepted that common shares *intended to earn dividends* qualify, even if the dividend yield is low, as long as there’s a reasonable expectation of some income ([](https://ca.rbcwealthmanagement.com/documents/1874925/1874941/Borrowing+to+Invest+-+When+is+Interest+Tax+Deductible.pdf/a299fc9b-245d-4ff5-bb3b-04b970fa4a24#:~:text=Common%20shares%20If%20you%20borrow,purpose%20even%20on%20an%20ordinary)). It’s something to be mindful of – for safety, one might invest borrowed money in a balanced portfolio or dividend-paying stocks, etc., to solidify the interest deduction claim.
  - In Quebec, note that the provincial rules differ (you can only deduct interest to the extent of investment income in the year, with carry-forwards) ([](https://ca.rbcwealthmanagement.com/documents/1874925/1874941/Borrowing+to+Invest+-+When+is+Interest+Tax+Deductible.pdf/a299fc9b-245d-4ff5-bb3b-04b970fa4a24#:~:text=If%20you%20live%20in%20Quebec%2C,investment%20income%20in%20other%20years)), but for most provinces, the federal rules above apply fully.

- **Using Capital Losses and Tax Management:** By deferring selling, you also defer being able to use losses. If the market drops and your portfolio goes down, you won’t realize a capital loss unless you sell. Some sophisticated investors might intentionally realize losses (tax-loss harvesting) while still avoiding gains. For instance, if some stocks dropped, you could sell those to capture a loss (which can offset future gains) and simultaneously maybe borrow to buy a similar but not identical investment (to maintain exposure). This gets into active tax management. The big picture: BBD defers gains, but you can still realize losses when advantageous, which can further reduce tax when you eventually have to recognize gains.

- **Keeping Income Low (Benefit Clawbacks, etc.):** If you’re retired or have a modest income aside from investments, not selling assets can keep your taxable income low. This might help you avoid things like OAS clawbacks or higher tax brackets on other income. Borrowed money doesn’t affect government benefits or your tax bracket. For example, a retiree with a $1M portfolio might only show minimal dividend income and perhaps some RRSP/RRIF withdrawals. If they don’t sell large chunks for cash, their taxable income might stay in a lower bracket, whereas if they sold $100k of stock with big gains, it could spike their income for that year. By smoothing out income through borrowing, they might save on taxes and retain benefits. They do, however, accumulate a debt that will need servicing.

- **Estate Considerations:** When you die with a loan against your assets, the net estate is smaller (since the debt will be paid out of the assets). Interestingly, this can mean that a portion of your asset’s appreciation effectively never gets taxed as a capital gain because it went to the lender. Here’s an example: you have a $1M stock portfolio with $200k cost base (so $800k unrealized gain). You borrow $300k against it over time and at death the portfolio is worth $1.2M. Your estate sells the portfolio, pays back the $300k loan, and is left with $900k. The capital gain on the final tax return is $1.2M – $200k = $1M gain (half taxable = $500k taxable). The tax on that maybe ~$250k (if ~50% rate). So from $1.2M, $300k went to lender, $250k to CRA, leaving ~$650k to heirs. If you *hadn’t* borrowed, you’d have $1.2M with $250k tax = $950k to heirs. So one could say the estate ended up smaller partly because of the debt. But note during life you got to use that $300k loan. In essence, part of the asset’s value was consumed by you (via the loan) and that portion didn’t go to taxes (debt repayment comes before taxes in estate settling). In our example, the $300k loan meant you enjoyed $300k, and the tax was only on the investment gains. If you had sold $300k during life to spend, you’d have paid tax on each sale. This is a bit of a philosophical point: debt repayment is subtracted from your estate *pre-tax*, so some argue “borrow, die” lets you consume wealth that would otherwise be taxed. The flip side is you’re also leaving a debt behind which reduces what heirs get, so it’s not exactly dodging tax so much as choosing to spend some money (via loans) rather than leaving it all to be taxed and inherited. For the ultra-wealthy in the U.S., the ideal is assets go to heirs tax-free and loans get wiped out by the stepped-up basis – that part doesn’t apply in Canada, so any unrealized gains will be taxed eventually ([Buy, Borrow, Die – Explained | Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41408772#:~:text=Why%3F%20The%20moment%20someone%20passes,it%20has%20already%20been%20taxed)). But using loans can, in effect, prioritize your use of the assets over the government’s cut, within limits.

- **Potential Future Tax Changes:** A note of caution – tax laws can change. There have been discussions (in the U.S. primarily) about taxing unrealized gains for wealthy individuals or eliminating certain loopholes. In Canada, one rumor that periodically arises is increasing the capital gains inclusion rate (from 50% to, say, 75%). If that happened, the deferred tax bill at death would be larger. It wouldn’t nullify the strategy, but it could reduce its benefit. There’s also a general anti-avoidance rule (GAAR) in Canadian tax law, but using loans instead of selling isn’t considered abusive – it’s a commercial transaction. Still, very aggressive planning (like circular loan schemes purely for tax benefit) could attract CRA’s attention. The straightforward BBD (take a loan, avoid selling) is currently within the rules, but always keep an eye on tax reforms if you plan to do this for decades.

In summary, **Canadian tax implications** of BBD: you get deferral of capital gains and possibly a better timing of income, you might get interest deductibility if structured right (which can be a significant benefit), but you cannot escape the capital gains tax entirely forever (except via charitable donation or if you manage to consume assets in a way that leaves no estate – but then nothing goes to heirs either). The strategy is largely about *tax deferral* and *tax rate optimization* over your lifetime.

## Risks and Regulatory Considerations

While “Buy, Borrow, Die” can yield benefits, it also comes with risks – especially for someone who doesn’t have billions in buffer. Key risks and things to watch out for include:

- **Market Volatility & Margin Calls:** If you’ve borrowed against volatile assets (like stocks), a market downturn can put your strategy in jeopardy. For example, you borrow 50% against a stock portfolio. If the market drops by 40%, your loan might exceed the allowed percentage of the now-shrunken portfolio, and you’ll get a margin call. You could be forced to sell assets at the worst possible time (when prices are low) to pay down the loan ([Securities-based lending - RBC Clearing & Custody](https://www.rbcclearingandcustody.com/en-us/products-and-services/securities-based-lending/#:~:text=Similar%20to%20a%20margin%20loan%2C,be%20sold%20without%20prior%20notice)). This not only locks in investment losses but could trigger taxable gains on any positions that still have gains (or deny you the full benefit of losses if you’re forced to sell at a loss but you have no gains to offset – unused capital losses carry forward, but still, it’s not ideal). **Mitigation:** Keep loan-to-value conservative (don’t max out your borrowing limit; borrow much less than the maximum allowed so you have a cushion). Diversify your collateral (so one asset’s drop doesn’t hit you too hard). Have other funds available as backup (e.g., keep some cash or unused credit that you could use to meet a margin call).  
- **Interest Rate Risk:** The cost of borrowing is not static. Many SBL arrangements and HELOCs are variable rate. If interest rates rise significantly, the strategy could turn from minimally costly to very expensive. For instance, many investors in the 2010s could borrow at ~2-3% and invest in assets growing at 7-8% – a comfortable spread. In 2022-2023, rates jumped; suddenly margin loans/HELOCs might cost ~6-8%, which for some may exceed the returns their investments generate. If your loan interest rate exceeds your asset growth or yield, you’re going backwards (unless the sole goal is tax deferral and you’re comfortable paying that interest cost for that benefit). Moreover, rising interest costs might force you to liquidate some assets to cover interest payments if you don’t have other income. The ultra-wealthy sometimes sidestep this by negotiating **fixed-rate loans** for long durations or by having such low rates (due to size/credit) that even after some hikes it’s manageable ([Buy, Borrow, Die Method, but how do you pay it back? : r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1fxe0d2/buy_borrow_die_method_but_how_do_you_pay_it_back/#:~:text=but%20it%20still%20presents%20a,term%20planning)). As an average person, you likely can’t get a multi-decade fixed low-rate on a securities-based loan. However, you could partially hedge by fixing portions of your debt (e.g., if you refinance a chunk of your HELOC into a fixed mortgage, or if a bank offers a fixed-rate investment credit for a term). **Mitigation:** Keep an eye on interest rate trends. Lock in rates when they are low, if possible. Don’t over-leverage to the point where you can’t afford payments if rates rise a few percent. Have a plan B (like the ability to divert some dividends or other income to cover interest if needed, or to temporarily reduce the loan if it becomes too costly).  
- **Cash Flow and Liquidity:** A critical practical issue: you must service the debt. Even if you don’t have to pay principal for years, the interest will be due periodically (monthly or annually). For “Buy, Borrow, Die” to work, you need to handle these interest payments without imploding your finances. If you’re still earning a salary, perhaps you can pay interest from that. If you’re retired, maybe from pensions or portfolio income. Some might consider borrowing *more* to pay interest – i.e., capitalizing the interest. For example, if you have a $1M portfolio, you borrow $50k and owe, say, $2.5k interest per year, you could add that $2.5k to the loan (if you have the credit room). That way the interest doesn’t immediately eat into your cash flow, but it does increase the debt. This can snowball and is dangerous if done excessively – it’s essentially negative amortization. Most lenders won’t formally allow you to add interest to the loan balance beyond your credit limit, so you need the capacity within your collateral. An estate attorney on Reddit pointed out that for ordinary people, coming up with cash to pay interest is a major hurdle – you might end up having to use **taxable income** (like your salary) to pay interest on a loan that was meant to avoid taxes, which can feel counterproductive ([Buy, Borrow, Die Method, but how do you pay it back? : r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1fxe0d2/buy_borrow_die_method_but_how_do_you_pay_it_back/#:~:text=The%20major%20problem%20with%20the,cash%20can%20add%20up%20quickly)). Ultra-wealthy folks often have other investments or cash flows (rents, business income, etc.) or they sell a small fraction of assets occasionally (incurring some tax, but maybe minimal) to cover interest. **Mitigation:** Ensure your plan includes a sustainable way to pay interest. One approach is to only borrow up to the amount that the *natural income* from your assets can cover. For example, if your $1M stock portfolio yields $20k in dividends, and you borrow such that interest is $10k/year, those dividends can pay the interest (and you still have $10k dividends left for other uses). In that case, your asset’s cash yield is supporting the loan, and you’re not forced to dip elsewhere. This requires that the asset yields are somewhat aligned with interest rates – not always the case (growth stocks might yield almost nothing, in which case you’re relying on selling shares eventually to pay interest – which again is counter to the strategy). 
- **Credit Line Adjustments and Loan Call Risk:** Aside from margin calls due to asset declines, lenders can sometimes change terms or call loans even if collateral is fine. For example, a bank might decide to reduce its exposure to certain types of lending or revalue how much they’ll lend on certain assets. Securities-based lines of credit are often demand loans – the bank can demand full repayment at any time (this is stated in the fine print, although they typically won’t unless something concerns them). In 2008, some people had HELOCs limits cut or frozen as the financial crisis hit – suddenly their access to cash was gone or reduced. It’s rare, but possible, that a lender could say “we’re not renewing this facility” or “we want to reduce your margin loan.” If that happens, you’d have to scramble to find cash or another lender. **Mitigation:** Diversify lenders if borrowing large amounts (owe some to a broker, some to a bank, so you’re not relying on one source). Maintain a good relationship and communication with the lender – if you’re a good client (e.g., also have assets with them), they have more incentive to keep you financed. Keep some cushion so you could refinance elsewhere if needed (maybe maintain good credit so you could quickly switch to another bank or broker’s loan if one pulled the plug).
- **Asset-Liability Mismatch:** BBD works best when your assets’ growth outpaces the interest on the debt. If that flips, you’re in trouble. For example, say you borrow heavily against a stock portfolio expecting ~8% returns and pay 4% interest. If instead the market goes into a flat decade and only returns 2% total and you’re paying 4-5% interest, you’ve eroded your principal. A real risk for an average investor is **sequence of returns** – if early in retirement or early in this strategy you hit a rough patch in the market but keep accumulating interest or additional loans, your net worth may not recover. The ultra-wealthy can often wait out long slumps; someone with $1M might not have the luxury if they’re depending on that money.  
- **Emotional and Behavioral Factors:** Managing debt against your investments can be stressful. If you’re constantly worried about margin calls or watching interest accrue, it might lead to panic decisions (like selling at a wrong time or paying off the loan at a suboptimal moment). It takes discipline and a certain risk tolerance to stick with the strategy. Some people also fall into the trap of *over-borrowing* because it’s so easy to get cash via loans when times are good – they might take on debt to invest more (leveraging up, effectively doubling down on the market), which can amplify losses in a downturn. It’s important to set personal limits and monitor the health of your overall plan. 
- **Regulatory Changes:** We touched on potential tax law changes already. Additionally, regulators like OSFI could adjust rules around lending. For instance, there have been talks about limiting combined loan-to-value on HELOCs or tightening margin requirements in volatile times. These could indirectly force your hand (e.g., if margin requirements are raised, you might have to reduce your loan). Also, if you’re using a corporation or trust in your strategy, keep abreast of any rules (like the recent changes in how private corporations’ passive investment income is treated – which might affect if someone tries to do this within a corporation). While such factors are generally more relevant to complex scenarios, an average investor should at least be aware that the financial system environment can change.

**In summary, the main risks** for an average person doing BBD are getting overstretched with debt, market downturns, rising interest costs, and ultimately being forced to liquidate under unfavorable conditions. Unlike a guaranteed loan against a fully stable asset, loans against investments carry an extra layer of risk because the collateral can shrink in value. 

One Reddit commenter (an apparent tax attorney) bluntly noted that these strategies “do not make sense for ordinary people” largely because of the difficulty of handling the interest and because regular folks **“simply cannot get the fixed rate, ultra low interest products that make this type of planning attractive”** ([Buy, Borrow, Die Method, but how do you pay it back? : r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1fxe0d2/buy_borrow_die_method_but_how_do_you_pay_it_back/#:~:text=but%20it%20still%20presents%20a,term%20planning)). That’s a caution that while the mechanics are available to you, the terms won’t be as sweet as they are for a billionaire, so the margin for error is thin. As a $1M investor, you have to be more careful to avoid turning tax deferral into a financial setback.

## Differences: Ultra-Wealthy vs. Average Millionaire Implementation

The “Buy, Borrow, Die” strategy is often associated with billionaires like Elon Musk (who reportedly borrows against his shares) or other ultra-high-net-worth families. How they do it, and the benefits they reap, can differ greatly from what an average millionaire can achieve. Here are some key differences:

- **Loan Terms & Interest Rates:** The ultra-wealthy typically secure far better loan terms. Private banks may offer them enormous credit lines at very fine rates – sometimes even below normal market rates – because these clients bring lots of business (investments, banking, etc.). In fact, bespoke loan deals might be available only for extremely large loans (some insiders suggest that the kind of ultra-cheap, no-margin-call loans that make “die with debt” truly optimal usually have a **floor around $300M** in assets) ([Buy, Borrow, Die Method, but how do you pay it back? : r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1fxe0d2/buy_borrow_die_method_but_how_do_you_pay_it_back/#:~:text=there%20necessarily%20some%20money%20lost,to%20getting%20preferential%20loan%20rates)) ([Buy, Borrow, Die Method, but how do you pay it back? : r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1fxe0d2/buy_borrow_die_method_but_how_do_you_pay_it_back/#:~:text=discuss%20in%20the%20post)). Those folks might get, say, a fixed loan at 2% interest locked in for many years, using their $300M stock portfolio as collateral, with very giving terms on collateral requirements. An average millionaire, on the other hand, is looking at off-the-shelf products: a margin loan at standard rates or a HELOC at prime. You won’t get a bank to give you money “below treasury rates” just because you have $1M – they reserve the special deals for the truly massive clients. In short, the rich get cheaper debt (and often higher LTV allowances) which makes the strategy more profitable and safer for them (lower interest = easier to outpace with investment returns) ([Buy, Borrow, Die Method, but how do you pay it back? : r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1fxe0d2/buy_borrow_die_method_but_how_do_you_pay_it_back/#:~:text=but%20it%20still%20presents%20a,term%20planning)).
- **Access to Sophisticated Credit Products:** Beyond rates, the ultra-wealthy have access to creative financing. They can use strategies like non-recourse stock loans, structured notes, or derivatives to monetize assets with minimal risk to their lifestyle. For example, they might borrow against a concentrated stock position using a collar (hedging the downside, which a bank might require) combined with a loan. Or they could have a family office set up complex leveraging across many assets. They also often borrow through entities (trusts or holding companies) for additional legal protection or tax planning. The average millionaire will be using pretty straightforward tools (brokerage margin, bank LOC, etc.). Also, private banking often provides a “one-stop” credit line secured by a **mix** of assets – for instance, they might take your portfolio, house, and other holdings into account and give you a giant line of credit. For a very wealthy client, they’ll do that as a custom solution. For a $1M client, banks typically won’t go that far; you’ll have to manage separate loans yourself.
- **Risk Management & Diversification:** A billionaire employing BBD might be doing so with a widely diversified set of assets and professional management. They can afford to let some investments drop or even go bust without jeopardizing their overall plan. Plus, they can devote resources to active risk management (hedging strategies, insurance, etc.). In contrast, an average millionaire might have most of their net worth in a couple of assets (say a house and a retirement portfolio). They don’t have the same level of diversification or buffers. If one asset class tanks, it’s a bigger hit to their net worth. Therefore, the stakes of borrowing against that asset are higher for them. The wealthy might borrow 10% of their assets and it’s a huge amount of money, but if things go south, they’re still 90% rich. An average person might borrow 10% of assets and if things go south, their retirement could be in peril. Often, the ultra-wealthy also have **unrealized losses** or other strategies to offset gains if they ever need to realize them. They can coordinate across a broad portfolio. The average person usually doesn’t have that flexibility (their portfolio is smaller and likely mostly gains if they’ve held long-term).
- **Repayment and Cash Flow:** The ultra-wealthy can play the game almost indefinitely. They may never plan to repay the loans during their life – they might even let interest accrue or just pay interest out of a portion of their portfolio’s income. For instance, a billionaire could live off a loan of $10M a year, pay a few hundred thousand in interest (which could come from dividend income or selling a tiny slice of stock), and do that forever. Their portfolio might be growing faster than the debt anyway. When they die, their estate or trusts have strategies to settle debts. Often, they aim to **never** pay capital gains tax; instead, they might use estate planning to eliminate it (like donating some assets to cover tax, or using insurance and trusts). In the U.S., many truly end up paying **zero estate tax** as well through trusts and foundations ([Buy, Borrow, Die Method, but how do you pay it back? : r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1fxe0d2/buy_borrow_die_method_but_how_do_you_pay_it_back/#:~:text=It%E2%80%99s%20extremely%20unusual%20for%20any,tax%20is%20reduced%20to%20zero)), whereas an average person’s estate is straightforward and will pay the taxes. The average millionaire likely cannot just keep debt forever without a plan – at some point, if they need to reduce debt (maybe as they age and lenders get wary, or if interest costs become too much), they might have to sell assets and pay tax, meaning the “die” step was only a partial deferral. Also, if an average person wants to leave something for heirs, they might actually prefer to pay off debt before death (since the heirs will be stuck handling it otherwise). Many moderate net worth individuals are uncomfortable dying with large debts, whereas the ultra-rich view it as just another financial tool and assume their executors will sort it out.
- **Estate Strategies:** Ultra-wealthy individuals incorporate “borrow, die” into a broader estate strategy: they may use **trusts** to hold assets (so that when they die, the assets aren’t directly in their name and can continue without triggering taxes in some cases), or **permanent life insurance** to cover taxes and loans, or **charitable foundations** to take assets (avoiding tax and achieving philanthropic goals, with family members often controlling the foundation). They often perform an **estate freeze**, especially in Canada – meaning they freeze the value of their shares at today’s value (capping their tax exposure) and pass future growth to heirs. Then they might borrow against those frozen shares for living expenses. When they die, the tax is only on the frozen value (which they might have planned for), and the growth is in the heirs’ hands (sometimes tax-deferred further). These techniques are not usually available to or even necessary for someone with $1M. An average millionaire might simply rely on the basic principal residence exemption (if they have a home, that portion has no tax on gains) and the fact that their estate isn’t subject to any special taxes beyond final income tax. They may use a simpler life insurance policy to cover the expected tax on their assets. For example, a person might calculate that when they’re, say, 90 years old, the capital gains tax on their portfolio might be $200k – so they get a life insurance policy that will pay out $200k to cover that. The cost of insurance is effectively another expense to account for, which the ultra-wealthy also consider (just on a larger scale with fancy insurance trusts and so on).
- **Scale of Benefits vs. Costs:** For the ultra-wealthy, the absolute dollar savings from BBD are enormous – they might avoid tens of millions in taxes and have access to tens of millions in virtually tax-free funds via loans. The costs (interest paid, legal fees, bank fees) are a small fraction of that, and they often can negotiate those down (banks might give them lower rates or even waive some fees to keep their business). For a $1M portfolio, the potential tax savings are maybe in the tens of thousands of dollars range (e.g., deferring a $100k capital gain tax bill for many years). Meanwhile, the interest costs on loans and any fees could also be in the tens of thousands if not careful. The **margin for net benefit is thinner**. It can still be positive – e.g., deferring $10k of tax each year for 20 years and paying $5k of interest each year might net out in your favor if the portfolio grows – but it’s not as obviously a slam dunk. And if something goes wrong, the impact is more personally significant. That’s why the ultra-wealthy are comfortable leveraging up – they have teams to manage it and ample cushion – whereas a normal investor has to personally sleep at night with the strategy in place.
- **Psychological Difference:** For billionaires, using debt strategically is almost academic – they know they have more than enough assets to cover any loan, and it’s purely an optimization. For an average person, carrying a large debt against their nest egg can be nerve-wracking and requires a strong conviction in the long-term plan. There’s also a lifestyle difference: a billionaire borrowing to fund a lavish lifestyle still leaves plenty of wealth untouched. An average person might be borrowing just to fund a comfortable retirement – it’s closer to the line between comfort and financial stress. So the tolerance and objectives differ: ultra-wealthy might do BBD to maximize dynasty wealth and tax efficiency, whereas an average millionaire might do it to slightly accelerate their retirement or avoid having to sell investments at an inopportune time, a more modest goal.

In essence, **scale matters**. The rich play by a different set of rules (or rather, they can fully utilize the rules) – they get better loan deals, can sustain the strategy longer, and have ways to mitigate the eventual taxes better than the average person. That doesn’t mean the strategy can’t work at a smaller scale; it just means the approach must be more conservative and carefully weighed for someone with $1M.

## Practical Implementation for a $1M Net Worth Individual

Putting it all together, let’s consider how someone with around $1 million net worth in Canada might actually use the “Buy, Borrow, Die” strategy in a practical, step-by-step way, and whether it would be worthwhile:

1. **Assess Your Net Worth Composition:** First, break down that $1M. Is it $1M all in stocks? Or $600k house + $400k in investments? The strategy will depend on what assets you have. Suppose for illustration you have: \[a\] a $700k house (with a small remaining mortgage), \[b\] $300k in a taxable investment portfolio, and \[c\] some RRSP/TFSA savings (let’s say $200k, although borrowing against registered accounts isn’t possible). Your total net worth might be slightly more than $1M in this case, but the key *usable* assets for BBD are the home equity and the $300k taxable portfolio. If instead you have $1M all in stocks, that gives you more to work with on the investment loan side, but maybe no real estate.

2. **Set Up Credit Lines:** You’d likely want to establish both a **portfolio line of credit** (or enable margin on your brokerage) and a **home equity line of credit**. For the portfolio: perhaps move the $300k investments to a broker like Interactive Brokers or your bank’s brokerage and get margin capability. With $300k at IB, you could potentially borrow up to ~$150k (50%). With $300k at a bank brokerage, maybe similar, but at higher interest. For the home: on a $700k house with, say, $200k mortgage left, you might be able to add a HELOC for up to 80% of value = $560k total loans, minus the $200k mortgage = $360k available as a HELOC. That HELOC limit is large, but you don’t have to use it fully (and likely shouldn’t). Even if your house is smaller or you don’t want to max it, you could easily have a six-figure credit line. Setting these up does a few things: it gives you **flexibility** to choose where to borrow from at any given time (stock loan vs home), and it acts as an emergency fund/buffer (which is comforting when you’re doing this strategy – you know you have liquidity if needed quickly).

3. **Use Borrowing for Cash Needs:** Now, when you need money for something – say living expenses, a car, a vacation, etc. – instead of selling investments or withdrawing RRSP (taxable) or TFSA (TFSA is tax-free but then loses future tax-free growth room), you’d tap one of the credit lines. For example, you want $50k for a new car. Rather than selling $50k of stocks (and maybe paying capital gains tax on $20k of gains), you draw $50k from your HELOC at ~6% interest, or from your margin at IB at ~4% interest. Let’s say you choose the HELOC for now. You’re now paying interest on that $50k (maybe $3k/year at 6%). You haven’t touched your investments – they continue to grow and produce dividends. If you use the money for personal purposes, that interest isn’t deductible (so it’s a true cost). If you use some of it for investment (maybe you buy some stocks with a portion), you could deduct interest proportionally. But let’s keep it simple: you’ve borrowed for personal use. Over the next year, you pay the interest using your employment income or other cash flow.

4. **Monitor and Adjust:** Suppose a year or two later, your stocks have gone up 20%. Your $300k portfolio is now $360k. You have a $50k HELOC debt. At this point, you might decide to rebalance the strategy. Maybe interest rates on the HELOC went up, and it’s now, say, 7%. IB margin might still be around 4-5%. You could choose to transfer that debt: borrow on margin to pay off the HELOC (essentially moving the loan from being against your house to being against your stocks). Now the interest is lower – a win. But now your stocks are the collateral. If the market subsequently drops, you’d face a margin call risk on that $50k. So you weigh the pros/cons. Alternatively, you might sell a small portion of stocks, pay off the $50k entirely, and then immediately re-borrow that $50k on margin to buy stocks back – this is the *interest deductibility shuffle* we mentioned. If done properly, now you have a $50k margin loan that was clearly used to buy investments, so the ~$2.5k interest on it could be deducted on your taxes, potentially saving you ~$1k (if you’re in ~40% tax bracket, for example). Meanwhile, you realized some gains when you sold – but perhaps you had some capital loss carryforwards or you sold something with minimal gains. This kind of fine-tuning can ensure you’re getting tax deductions and the lowest rate financing.

5. **Continue to Avoid Unnecessary Asset Sales:** Over a period of years, follow the principle that when you need cash, you consider loans first. You don’t liquidate your RRSP or stocks unless there’s a strong reason. This defers taxes on RRSP withdrawals (though by age 72 you’d have to start RRIF withdrawals – that’s another planning element) and defers capital gains on stock sales. You’re effectively *incrementally* increasing your debt. Let’s say over 10 years, you borrow a total of $200k gradually (either as one growing loan or multiple loans). Some of that could be interest itself if you didn’t pay it from other income. Now you have $200k debt and maybe your assets have grown from $1M to $1.5M (just as an example). Your net worth is still $1.3M (because $1.5M assets – $200k debt), which might be higher than if you had been selling assets to fund expenses (since selling would have reduced the asset base and incurred taxes along the way).

6. **Risk Management Along the Way:** All this time, you keep an eye on the health of the strategy. If a big market downturn happens (like your $360k portfolio falls to $250k in a crash), you might temporarily shift strategy – perhaps draw on the HELOC instead of margin (since your stocks have less headroom now) to avoid forced sales. Or if interest rates spike, you might pause borrowing and even use some cash or income to pay down interest or principal to stay comfortable. The key is to remain flexible – **BBD doesn’t mean you *must* always borrow and never sell**; it means you preferentially borrow to avoid selling, but you can still sell when advantageous. For instance, if a stock you own becomes extremely overvalued, it might make sense to sell it despite the tax, rather than dogmatically holding it and borrowing more. You could then use the proceeds to pay down debt (improving your leverage position) or buy something else. The strategy is not all-or-nothing; partial implementations can still yield benefit.

7. **Plan for the End Game:** As you get older, think about how this will resolve. Perhaps you’re comfortable letting the loans run until death, knowing your estate will handle it. In that case, ensure you keep good records of what interest was deductible (your executor will need those for final tax returns) and consider having life insurance or other liquid assets to cover the loan and tax. Alternatively, you might target an exit strategy: say, *when I’m 80, I’ll sell my rental property or some stocks to eliminate the debt so I can live debt-free in later old age.* This can be a valid approach – you still benefited from decades of deferral. Or maybe you plan to downsize your home at some point: you could use proceeds from selling a house to clear the loans and simplify. Each person’s plan will differ. The ultra-wealthy typically never fully exit the strategy (it often continues through generations), but for an average person it might make sense to eventually wind it down, depending on comfort and heirs.

**Is it a viable strategy?** For a $1M net-worth Canadian, *viability* depends on discipline and circumstances. It can certainly work in the sense that you can defer taxes and access cash when you need it. Many people do elements of this, perhaps without calling it BBD. For example, a retiree might use a HELOC for a year or two of living expenses to delay tapping their RRSP (maybe to age 71, to maximize tax deferral), then pay it off when RRIF starts – that’s a form of “borrow instead of sell, then later settle”. Or someone might use margin loans to avoid selling in a bull market, then when they want to reduce risk, they sell some assets to clear the loan in a year when it makes tax sense (perhaps a low-income year).

However, it’s not a strategy to **max out** unless you truly understand and accept the risks. A $1M investor who borrows $800k against everything will almost certainly get into trouble. A more modest use – like maintaining, say, 10-20% of your net worth as a loan – is less risky and can still achieve most of the tax deferral benefit. For example, borrowing 10% of assets for extra cash and letting your assets grow could allow you to live a bit larger or invest more while only slightly levering your risk.

One of the biggest challenges for the average person is that the **tax benefit is somewhat limited** (deferral, not avoidance) and the interest cost is tangible every year. If your loan is not tax-deductible (because you used it for personal use), then you’re trading a future tax (which might be, say, 25% of the gain) for a sure cost now (interest, which could be 4-7% annually). That can be a losing trade if done too long or at high rates. If you manage to make the interest deductible by structuring as an investment loan, then you’re in a better position – at least the interest effectively costs ~half as much after tax. 

**Numerical perspective:** Imagine your $1M portfolio grows at 6% per year ($60k gain). If you needed $60k to live, you could borrow that each year. After one year, you have ~$60k debt. After 10 years, maybe $600k debt (ignoring interest compounding for a moment) and your portfolio might have grown to ~$1.8M (if it compounded, but minus any drag from interest if you paid interest from it or added to debt). You’ve essentially siphoned off the growth via loans, leaving the principal intact. At death (say after 10 years), $600k debt gets paid, and $1.2M is left to your estate (minus capital gains tax on the growth). Versus the alternative of selling $60k each year – you’d pay tax each time but maybe never accumulate debt. It’s complex to say which yields more after all taxes and interest; it can tilt either way depending on rates and returns. BBD tends to come out ahead if returns are strong and interest rates/taxes are moderate, and comes out behind if returns disappoint or interest is high.

Crucially, **quality of life and risk tolerance** play a role. If BBD allows you to enjoy your wealth more (because you feel free to use borrowed money to, say, buy a vacation property or support your kids now, knowing you don’t have to liquidate investments to do so), that’s a non-monetary benefit too. Many wealthy individuals use leverage *opportunistically* – not just to avoid tax, but to seize opportunities (like investing in a new business, funding a child’s education or home purchase, etc.) without derailing their investment plan. An average millionaire can do the same on a smaller scale.

So, **yes, it is viable** in the sense that the financial tools exist and many of the benefits (tax deferral, liquidity) can be realized by a person with $1M. But **viable** doesn’t mean it’s always a good idea – it must be executed carefully. If mismanaged, the strategy can lead to debt problems or a smaller estate than if you just paid the taxes and avoided interest. As one commenter noted, the economics often *“would not make sense for ordinary people”* if they try to fully mirror what billionaires do ([Buy, Borrow, Die Method, but how do you pay it back? : r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1fxe0d2/buy_borrow_die_method_but_how_do_you_pay_it_back/#:~:text=The%20rules%20are%20similar%20in,S)) ([Buy, Borrow, Die Method, but how do you pay it back? : r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1fxe0d2/buy_borrow_die_method_but_how_do_you_pay_it_back/#:~:text=but%20it%20still%20presents%20a,term%20planning)). The average person should implement a **conservative version** of BBD: borrow modestly against solid assets, keep costs low (use the cheapest lending source available), and always re-evaluate as conditions change.

## Conclusion: Is “Buy, Borrow, Die” Worth it for a $1M Canadian?

For a Canadian individual with roughly $1M net worth, the “Buy, Borrow, Die” strategy can be a **useful tool**, but it’s not a slam-dunk strategy to get rich or avoid all taxes. It essentially allows tax **deferral** and liquidity by leveraging assets, which can improve your financial outcomes *if managed prudently*. You gain the ability to use your asset value without immediate tax friction, and you postpone capital gains taxes potentially until the end of your life. This can let your investments compound longer and give you more spending power in the interim.

However, it’s important to recognize the **limitations and risks** at this scale. In Canada, you cannot completely escape the tax – eventually, the CRA will collect capital gains taxes at death or when assets are sold ([Named in the Will? What to Know About Canadian Inheritance Tax Laws | 2023 TurboTax® Canada Tips](https://turbotax.intuit.ca/tips/do-you-pay-taxes-on-money-you-inherited-467#:~:text=In%20Canada%2C%20there%20is%20no,Why%3F#:~:text=When%20a%20loved%20one%20passes%2C,inheritance%20is%20immune%20from%20taxation)). You also don’t get the ultra-preferential loan rates that billionaires enjoy, so the interest costs to you are significant and can erode the benefits if not carefully watched. In other words, the **arbitrage** (using cheap money to avoid a higher tax) is thinner for an average person. A billionaire might borrow at 1-2% and avoid a 20% capital gains tax indefinitely – a huge win. A $1M investor might borrow at 5-6% to defer a 25% tax – that’s a much smaller spread, and it might even be negative in some years, meaning it could cost more in interest than the benefit of deferring tax.

**Practical insight:** For many average millionaires, a partial implementation is the sweet spot. For example, use a portfolio line of credit for short-term needs or to avoid selling in a bad market year, but also be willing to take gains when it makes sense (like if you’re in a low tax bracket one year or an asset is overvalued, go ahead and sell and pay some tax – you can use the loan in a different year). Use a HELOC to have flexibility, but maybe plan to clear it when you downsize your home or at some point when the cost of carrying it outweighs the benefit. Always compare the **after-tax cost of interest vs. the tax you’re deferring**. If you can deduct the interest, the scales tip more in favor of borrowing. If you can’t, then you’re paying interest with after-tax dollars – that’s a high hurdle, and you need strong investment growth to justify it.

It’s also worth noting the **personal financial goals**: If your goal is to maximize the inheritance for your children, BBD might not be ideal because the loan plus tax at death will eat into the estate (as opposed to you gradually paying some taxes and reducing debt, potentially leaving a smaller tax bill). On the other hand, if your goal is to enjoy as much of your wealth as possible while you’re alive (even if that means leaving less to heirs), BBD aligns with that – you’re essentially pulling future gains into the present via loans, which you get to use. You’re spending the bank’s money and letting the tax bill be sorted out later, which could be seen as “having your cake and eating it too,” as long as everything goes right.

**Bottom line:** “Buy, Borrow, Die” can be **viable for a $1M investor**, providing tax deferral and flexibility, but it should be used carefully and usually in moderation. The average millionaire should approach it as a strategy to optimize finances – not as a scheme to eliminate taxes entirely (since in Canada it won’t) – and be fully aware of the costs (interest and potential risks). Properly managed, it can enhance your financial efficiency: you keep investments growing untaxed and use OPM (other people’s money) to fund needs. But it’s not a free lunch; it substitutes one expense for another (tax for interest), and that trade-off needs to be monitored over time.

In conclusion, for someone with $1M in Canada, **a scaled-down “Buy, Borrow, Die”** is often a **practical strategy**: use asset-backed loans (from your stocks and home) to avoid premature asset sales, reap tax advantages like interest deductibility where possible, and strategically plan for the loan and tax eventually. You’ll want to remain flexible and not over-leverage, because unlike the ultra-rich, you don’t have unlimited avenues if things go wrong. Think of it as a lever to pull in your financial plan – one that can give you an edge – but not the only lever. Combine it with sensible investment management and tax planning. If done right, you’ll likely find that you’ve enjoyed more of your wealth’s benefits with only a marginal increase in risk, which is precisely the outcome that makes this strategy appealing. Just proceed with eyes open: leverage is a double-edged sword, and the goal is to make it work for you, not against you.
