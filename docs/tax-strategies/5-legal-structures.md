## What about regular people like me?

Given your situation, the optimal strategy would focus on maximizing tax efficiency, leveraging available accounts, and planning for estate transfer. Hereâ€™s a detailed plan:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**

- **TFSA (Tax-Free Savings Account)**:

  - **Contribution**: Max out your TFSA contributions every year. Currently, the limit is CAD 6,000 per year, and the total contribution room accumulates if you haven't contributed in past years.
  - **Growth and Withdrawals**: All growth and withdrawals are tax-free, making it ideal for long-term investments.

- **RRSP (Registered Retirement Savings Plan)**:
  - **Contribution**: Contribute to your RRSP to reduce your taxable income. The contribution limit is 18% of your earned income from the previous year, up to a maximum amount set by the government.
  - **Growth**: Investments grow tax-deferred. You only pay tax on withdrawals, ideally in retirement when yur income may be lower.

### 2. **Incorporate for Business Activities**

- **Professional Corporation**:
  - **Formation**: Consider forming a professional corporation if applicable (check provincial regulations).
  - **Income Splitting**: Pay yourself a reasonable salary and take additional income as dividends, which can be more tax-efficient.
  - **Tax Deferral**: Keep excess earnings within the corporation to benefit from lower corporate tax rates and defer personal taxes until you withdraw the funds.

### 3. **Investment Strategies**

- **Corporate Investments**:

  - **Corporation**: Invest through your corporation. This allows the retained earnings to grow at a lower tax rate.
  - **Borrowing**: Use thecorporation to borrow against your investments for personal use, potentially at lower interest rates, without triggering personal capital gains taxes.

- **Personal Investments**:
  - **Non-Registered Accounts**: For investments outside of TFSA and RRSP, focus on tax-efficient investments such as Canadian dividend-paying stocks (eligible for the dividend tax credit) or capital gains which are taxed at a lower rate than regular income.

### 4. **Estate Planning**

- **Trusts**:

  - **Family Trust**: Consider setting up a family trust to manage and protect your assets. Trusts can help in income splitting and transferring wealth to heirs with potential tax benefits.
  - \*_Testamentary Trust_: These trusts are created upon your death and can provide income-splitting benefits to your heirs.

- **Life Insurance**:
  - **Permanent Life Insurance**: Policies like Whole Life or Universal Life can be used to grow wealth tax-free within the policy. The death benefit can be used to pay off any loans taken against your investments or to provide a tax-free inheritance to your heirs.
