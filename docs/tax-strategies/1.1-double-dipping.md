## Double Dipping

"Double dipping" in the context of the "Buy, Borrow, Die" strategy refers to the ability to benefit from the same assets multiple times without incurring additional taxes. This can be achieved through strategic use of borrowed funds and reinvestment. Here's an example of how this can be applied:

### Example: Double Dipping with the "Buy, Borrow, Die" Strategy

#### Step 1: Buy

**Initial Investment**:

- Assume you have an initial net worth of $1,000,000.
- You invest this amount in a diversified portfolio of appreciating assets (stocks, real estate, etc.).

#### Step 2: Portfolio Growth

**Growth Over Time**:

- Over 10 years, assume your portfolio grows at an average annual rate of 7%.
- After 10 years, the portfolio value increases to approximately $1,967,151.36.

#### Step 3: Borrow

**Leveraging Assets**:

- You need $100,000 annually for living expenses.
- Instead of selling assets, you take out a loan against the portfolio using a securities-backed line of credit (SBLOC) with a loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of 50%.

**First Loan**:

- In the first year, you borrow $100,000 against the portfolio.
- The interest rate on the loan is 5%.

**Use of Funds**:

- Use the $100,000 for living expenses.
- Meanwhile, your portfolio continues to grow, undisturbed by the loan.

#### Step 4: Reinvestment (Double Dipping)

**Reinvesting Borrowed Funds**:

- Instead of using the entire $100,000 for living expenses, you decide to reinvest a portion back into your portfolio.
- Suppose you reinvest $50,000 of the borrowed amount.

**Portfolio Growth**:

- The reinvested $50,000 grows at the same 7% annual rate.
- After one year, the $50,000 grows to $53,500.

**Total Portfolio Value**:

- Despite the loan, your portfolio value is now boosted by the reinvestment and the appreciation on it.

#### Step 5: Ongoing Borrowing and Reinvestment

**Subsequent Years**:

- In the following years, you continue to borrow $100,000 annually.
- Each year, you reinvest $50,000 of the borrowed funds back into the portfolio.
- This cycle allows you to live on borrowed money while continually growing your portfolio.

### Detailed Calculation

**Year 1**:

- Portfolio Value: $1,967,151.36
- Borrowed Amount: $100,000
- Reinvested: $50,000
- Reinvested Growth: $50,000 \* 1.07 = $53,500

**Year 2**:

- New Portfolio Value: $1,967,151.36 + $53,500 = $2,020,651.36
- Borrowed Amount: $100,000
- Reinvested: $50,000
- Reinvested Growth: $50,000 \* 1.07 = $53,500

**Repeat for Each Subsequent Year**:

- Continuously reinvest $50,000 each year.
- Portfolio continues to grow with the added value from the reinvested funds.

### Benefits of Double Dipping

1. **Enhanced Portfolio Growth**:

   - Reinvesting a portion of borrowed funds allows for compounded growth on a larger base.
   - This enhances the overall growth rate of the portfolio.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:

   - Borrowing avoids triggering capital gains taxes.
   - Reinvesting borrowed funds keeps the portfolio growing without additional tax liabilities.

3. **Wealth Preservation**:
   - The principal portfolio remains largely untouched and continues to appreciate.
   - The strategy allows for living expenses to be covered without depleting the principal investment.

### Summary

Double dipping in the "Buy, Borrow, Die" strategy involves leveraging assets to borrow funds for living expenses, then reinvesting a portion of those borrowed funds back into the portfolio. This approach allows for continued portfolio growth and enhanced wealth accumulation while maintaining tax efficiency. By strategically reinvesting borrowed funds, you benefit from the appreciation on both the original investment and the reinvested amounts, effectively "double dipping" into the growth potential of your assets.
